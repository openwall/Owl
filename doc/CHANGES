This file lists the major changes made between Owl releases as well as
between the last released version and Owl-current.  While some of the
changes listed here may also be made to a stable branch, the complete
lists of stable branch changes are included with those branches and as
errata for the corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in change logs
for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 0.1-prerelease and Owl-current.

2001/06/24	Owl/doc/CHANGES
New file: the system-wide change log will now be maintained.

2001/06/21	Owl build environment
First attempt at supporting multiple branches.

2001/06/21 -
2001/06/23	Package: owl-setup
RELIABILITY FIX: Set the domain in /etc/resolv.conf, ensure the newly
created /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts are mode 644.

2001/06/20	Package: tcsh
Updated to 6.10.01 which includes a number of minor bugfixes.

2001/06/18	Package: pwdb
Updated to 0.61.1 which adds some header files.

2001/06/17	Package: libnet
Support alpha* targets other than plain alpha (don't even try to check
for unaligned accesses when building for an Alpha).

2001/06/17	Package: man-pages
Updated to 1.38.

2001/06/15	Package: shadow-utils
DOCUMENTATION FIX: Rewrote most of the login.defs(5) man page and
enabled its packaging.  Added more defaults to /etc/login.defs, added
a reference to login.defs(5).  Fixed a bug in the lastlog(8) man page
reported by Jarno Huuskonen.

2001/06/14	Package: openssh
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, remote, active
Prevent additional timing leaks with null passwords (when allowed).
The default OpenSSH server configuration on Owl doesn't allow null
passwords, making this a non-issue (not that it's much of an issue
either way).  When null passwords were allowed, the old package made
it somewhat easier for a remote attacker to check whether a username
is valid.

2001/06/14	Package: pam_userpass
RELIABILITY FIX: Deal with null passwords correctly.  Before this
change null passwords wouldn't work even when allowed for a service.

2001/06/13	Package: glibc
Back-ported a patch from the CVS to handle unaligned relocations on
Alpha.  Owl is now able to rebuild all of its packages on an Alpha
without causing a single unaligned trap.

2001/06/12	Package: rpm
Updated to 3.0.6.

2001/06/12	Package: screen
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local, passive
Updated to 3.9.9, patched the unsafe temporary file handling in the
configure script (which made it unsafe to _build_ screen).

2001/06/12	Package: xinetd
Updated to 2.1.8.9pre15.  With includedir, skip all files with names
containing a dot ('.') or ending with a tilde ('~'); this replaces the
Red Hat Linux derived patch.  Minor man page fixes.

2001/06/11	Package: openssh
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local, active
Switch credentials when cleaning up temporary files and sockets to fix
the vulnerability reported by zen-parse@gmx.net on Bugtraq which could
allow a local user to remove files named "cookies" located anywhere on
the system.  The patch is by Markus Friedl (intended for testing only)
with a later OpenSSH CVS change added and two bugs fixed.

2001/06/10 -
2001/06/13	Package: dialog
Updated to 0.9a-20010527 with minor bugfixes.

2001/06/07	Package: links
New package: a Lynx-like text WWW browser with support for frames.

2001/06/04	Owl/doc/CONTACT
New file: explains Owl public mailing lists (only owl-users at the
moment) and e-mail contacts.

2001/06/04	Package: logrotate
Enabled the daily cron job now that we have /etc/cron.daily (finally).
If log compression is requested, use gzip at its default compression
level (no "-9").

2001/06/03	Package: glibc
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low to medium, local, passive or active
Synced the fts(3) routines with current OpenBSD and FreeBSD; this is
triggered by Nick Cleaton's report of yet another FTS vulnerability
to FreeBSD, and a discussion with Kris Kennaway and Todd Miller.  It
should no longer be possible to trick FTS into leaving the intended
directory hierarchy, but DoS attacks on FTS itself remain possible.
The FTS code is used by software ported from BSD, including the Owl
mtree package.  GNU software uses other implementations, several of
which will need fixing as well (our findutils package includes a fix
since before the 0.1-prerelease, but there's room for improvement).

2001/06/03	Package: glibc
DOCUMENTATION FIX: Updated to crypt_blowfish-0.4.1 which includes a
crypt.3 man page that is more friendly to makewhatis.

2001/05/30	Package: gnupg
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low to high, remote, passive
Updated to 1.0.6, which includes a fix to the format string
vulnerability discovered by fish stiqz of Synnergy Networks.  This
vulnerability can allow a (possibly remote) attacker to execute
arbitrary code as the user who attempted decryption of a specially
crafted file.  While the potential impact of this vulnerability is
high, the chances of its successful exploitation in a real-world
attack are low due to technical and social reasons.

2001/05/29	Packages: SysVinit, xinetd, owl-startup
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, passive or active
Ensure the umask is no less restrictive than 022 when starting
programs from init, start-stop-daemon, and xinetd.  Set umask to 077
in daemon() for the case when a service is started manually rather
than from rc.sysinit.  Of these, only the xinetd behavior was a real
vulnerability on setups we support (Owl with third-party services
installed).  The change to init is only critical when running certain
2.4.x Linux kernel versions, which we don't yet support.  The changes
to start-stop-daemon and owl-startup are redundant.

2001/05/27	Package: gawk
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local, passive
Patched unsafe temporary file handling in igawk, based on report and
patch from Jarno Huuskonen (updated the igawk example in the texinfo
documentation for gawk, which is used as the source for building the
final igawk script).  This is a very minor security problem as igawk
is hardly ever used.

2001/05/27 -
2001/06/19	Package: popa3d
RELIABILITY FIX: Updated from an earlier development version to 0.4.9
and later to 0.4.9.1.

2001/05/23	Package: sysklogd
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local or remote, active
Back-ported a klogd DoS fix from 1.4.1, thanks to the reports from
Jarno Huuskonen and Thomas Roessler who initially reported the problem
to Debian (see http://bugs.debian.org/85478).  The problem would only
show up when the kernel or a kernel module incorrectly passes a NUL
byte for logging.  Linux 2.2.19 isn't known to have bugs like this,
some Linux 2.4.x kernels are.

2001/05/18	Owl/doc/CREDITS
New file: presents our development team and others involved with Owl.

2001/05/18 -
2001/05/25	Package: crontabs
New package: system crontab files which provide the /etc/cron.daily,
weekly, and monthly files as required by the LSB specification draft,
plus /etc/cron.hourly found on Red Hat Linux.  The package is based on
a modified version of the run-parts program derived from Debian.

2001/05/18 -
2001/06/12	Package: man
Updated to 1.5i and later to 1.5i2.  These versions are meant to fix
the published ways to attack man when it is installed SUID/SGID, but
the fixes are imperfect by design.  Owl has never installed man SUID
or SGID.  Additionally, our makewhatis script was fixed since before
we've released.  Thus, this isn't a security update.

2001/05/15	Owl/doc/fr/*
New files: French translations of the documentation, from Denis Ducamp
<Denis.Ducamp@hsc.fr>.
