Owl installation is currently more complicated than we'd like it to
be.  This is going to change with future releases.

At this stage, Owl doesn't include its own boot disks and installation
tools.  Thus, you need to boot into some other Linux system to install
Owl.  This other system needs to offer some GNU tools and RPM (version
3.0.5 is recommended, earlier ones may not work), but it doesn't have
to use RPM as its package manager.  You don't really have to install
that other system first: its boot CD's could be sufficient, provided
that you can mount a filesystem with Owl binary packages and CVS tree.

Once you get a Linux system booted, the first thing you need to do is
prepare the usual /usr/src/world setup, as explained in BUILD.  Then,
partition your disks for Owl as desired, mkfs, mkswap, and mount the
new filesystems under /owl (the default, as set in installworld.conf).
To actually install Owl, change directory to /usr/src/world and type:

	make installworld && make setup

If there are any problems during the "installworld" stage (watch for
the "Failed" lines), correct their cause and re-run the command.

Once the Owl userland is installed, you need to also install a kernel.
Currently, this needs to be a Linux 2.2 kernel, and we recommend that
you build the version available with Owl.

You may choose to configure the boot loader (LILO) available with Owl,
or you may use a boot loader already installed on the system (if any).
If you already have a Linux 2.2 system installed, you may use its boot
loader and even its kernel, by simply adding an entry with a different
root= setting (set to the device with Owl root filesystem).
