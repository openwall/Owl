"Owl" is a security-enhanced operating system with Linux and GNU
software as its core, compatible with other major distributions of
GNU/*/Linux-based systems.  It is intended as a server platform.


	The build environment and package management.

Unlike most other "Linux distributions", Owl includes a complete build
environment capable to re-build the entire system from source with one
simple command ("make buildworld").  However, the implementation of
"make buildworld" on Owl is very different from that available with
*BSD.  It is in fact more similar to *BSD ports/packages, covering the
entire Owl userland (that is, everything but the Linux kernel).

The Owl userland source code consists of two source trees, where each
Owl package is split between the two trees.  One source tree consists
of original archives as distributed by the authors or maintainers of
the corresponding software components.  The other tree, which we store
in a CVS repository, has the build specifications, patches, and other
Owl-specific additions to the packages.

Based on the two source trees, binary packages are built.  They can be
installed (with "make installworld") to update the system itself or to
create a new Owl installation (the ROOT= setting), or they can be
transferred over a network and installed elsewhere.

We're using RPM for the binary packages, as that allows for reasonable
dependency handling when installing packages from or intended for Red
Hat Linux and several other distributions, on an Owl system.
