This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 1.0 and Owl-current.

2002/10/21 -
2002/10/24	Packages: shadow-utils, tcb
Merged enhancements which remove the 32K users limit when /etc/tcb is
in use, documented them in tcb(5) and login.defs(5) manual pages.
Modified the tcb_chkpwd helper binary interface to support multiple
users per UID (the username is now passed as well).  Most of this was
prepared by August but delayed until after Owl 1.0 release.
