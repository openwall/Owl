This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 1.0 and Owl-current.

2003/02/20	Package: popa3d
Approached another stable release, 0.6.  The recent changes are
limited to minor bug fixes (documented in the package change log), so
this release is of more importance to uses on non-Owl.

2003/01/20	Package: mutt
New package: a feature-rich text-based mail user agent.  Our initial
package is based on Mutt 1.4i with many temporary file handling fixes.

2003/01/18	Package: xinetd
Updated to 2.3.10.

2003/01/10 -
2003/01/17	Package: dialog
Updated to 0.9b-20020814 with a patch needed for RSBAC administration
tools.  Corrected unsafe temporary file handling in the samples.

2003/01/17	Packages: utempter, libutempter, rpm, screen
Red Hat's utempter has been replaced with ALT Linux's libutempter
package, which features an improved API while still supporting the
old one for compatibility.  rpm has been enhanced to support symbol
versioning with automatic dependencies on libraries other than glibc
(packages which depend on libutempter's new API will use this), and
screen switched to the new API.

2003/01/12	Package: diffstat
Updated to 1.32.

2003/01/08	Package: owl-control
Added control(8) and control-dump(8) manual pages.

2003/01/07	Package: hdparm
Updated to 5.3.

2002/12/29	Package: nc
New package: ported netcat from OpenBSD (post-3.2).  netcat (nc) is a
simple utility for reading and writing data across network, using TCP
or UDP.

2002/12/19	Packages: tcp_wrappers, openssh, xinetd
Handle error conditions with tcp_wrappers' table matching, patch from
Steve Grubb.

2002/12/17	Package: rpm
Added rpminit(1), a script to setup a set of private directories for
building RPM packages as the current user.  Changed the default rpmrc
to use more optimal flags for our gcc (note that builds of Owl itself
use a different set of optimization flags anyway).

2002/12/14	Package: libnids
Updated to 1.17.

2002/12/12	Package: openssl
Updated to 0.9.6h.

2002/12/09	kernel
Updated to Linux 2.2.23-ow1.

2002/12/05	Owl/doc/TODO
New file: a public Owl TODO list.  Its primary purpose is to give some
ideas of how one may contribute to Owl development.

2002/10/24 -
2002/12/01	Package: owl-startup
Set net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1 to prevent the use of Owl
boxes for "smurf" attacks even when proper packet filters aren't in
place (suggested by Steve Olszewski).  Set net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
to defeat SYN flood attacks.  Documented (in /etc/sysctl.conf) the
security risk of having SYN cookies enabled with certain packet filter
setups.

2002/11/27	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: medium, local, active
Updated to Linux 2.2.22-ow2 which improves the "lcall" DoS fix for the
Linux kernel to cover the NT (Nested Task) flag attack discovered by
Christophe Devine.

2002/11/08	Package: glibc
RELIABILITY FIX: Made the x86 assembly code implementing bcrypt
password hashing reentrant (this time for real), made it more careful
about overwriting sensitive data.  At the same time, the default
/etc/nsswitch.conf file has been cleaned up and improved.

2002/11/07	Owl/doc/MIRRORING
New file: instructions for those who would like to setup and maintain
an Owl mirror, official or not.

2002/11/05	Package: hdparm
Updated to 5.2.

2002/11/03	Packages: owl-control,
		iputils, openssh, postfix, shadow-utils, SimplePAMApps,
		traceroute, util-linux, vixie-cron
Keep owl-control settings over package upgrades (and thus over "make
installworld" runs as well).  Some of the owl-control scripts updates
have been imported back from ALT Linux.

2002/10/21 -
2002/10/24	Packages: shadow-utils, tcb
Merged enhancements which remove the 32K users limit when /etc/tcb is
in use, documented them in tcb(5) and login.defs(5) manual pages.
Modified the tcb_chkpwd helper binary interface to support multiple
users per UID (the username is now passed as well).  Most of this was
prepared by August but delayed until after Owl 1.0 release.
