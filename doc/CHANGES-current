This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.

Security fixes have a "Severity" specified for the issue(s) being fixed.
The three comma-separated metrics given after "Severity:" are: risk
impact (low, medium, or high), attack vector (local, remote, or
indirect), and whether the attack may be carried out at will (active) or
not (passive).  Please note that the specified risk impact is just that,
it is not the overall severity, so other metrics are not factored into
it.  For example, a "high" impact "local, passive" issue is generally of
lower overall severity than a "high" impact "remote, active" one - this
is left up to our users to consider given their specific circumstances.

Per our current conventions, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability is
generally considered to have a "low" risk impact (even if it is a
"remote, active" one, which is to be considered separately as it may
make the vulnerability fairly critical under specific circumstances).
Some examples of "medium" impact vulnerabilities would be persistent DoS
(where the DoS effect does not go away with a (sub)system restart), data
loss, bugs enabling non-critical information leaks, cryptographic
signature forgeries, and/or sending of or accepting spoofed/forged
network traffic (where such behavior was unexpected), as long as they
would not directly allow for a "high" impact attack.  Finally, a typical
"high" impact vulnerability would allow for privilege escalation such as
ability to execute code as another user ID than the attacker's (a
"local" attack) or without "legitimately" having such an ability (a
"remote" attack).

The metrics specified are generally those for a worst case scenario,
however in certain cases ranges such as "none to low" or/and "local to
remote" may be specified, referring to the defaults vs. a worst case yet
"legitimate" custom configuration.  In some complicated cases, multiple
issues or attacks may be dealt with at once.  When those differ in their
severity metrics, we use slashes to denote the possible combinations.
For example, "low/none to high, remote/local" means that we've dealt
with issue(s) or attack(s) that are "low, remote" and those that are
"none to high, local".  In those tricky cases, we generally try to
clarify the specific issue(s) and their severities in the description.


	Changes made between Owl 3.1 and Owl-current.

2017/06/19	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
On SUID/SGID exec, limit the size of argv+envp to 512 KiB and the stack
size to 8 MiB, similarly to what grsecurity did in 2012.  This prevents
some of the stack/heap clash attacks described by Qualys, while some
others were already prevented for years by our glibc hardening changes.

2017/06/15	Package: db4
SECURITY FIX	Severity: medium to high, local, active
Don't open the DB_CONFIG file in the current directory.  This unexpected
property of db4 could have allowed for local DoS, information leaks, and
privilege escalation via programs using db4, including Postfix.

2017/06/08	Package: kernel
Backported upstream reimplementation of restricted hard links,
controllable via the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl and enabled by
default, similar to what we had as part of CONFIG_HARDEN_LINK in -ow
patches and what grsecurity had as part of CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_LINK.  This
reinforces the group crontab vs. root privilege separation in our
package of ISC/Vixie Cron.

2017/04/02	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Merged upstream fix to locking in net/ipv4/ping.c: ping_unhash(), where
the race condition could have been exploited by container root into e.g.
container escape.  Without a vulnerability in ping(1), the issue was not
triggerable by non-root users (neither host nor container).

2017/01/25	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Merged in a fix of use-after-free in the recvmmsg() exit path
(CVE-2016-7117) from Red Hat's -417.  The vulnerability appears likely
to be exploitable locally.  Remote exploitation might be possible as
well, but would require specific (unlikely?) behavior of a service.

2016/12/10	Package: kernel
Merged in Red Hat's CVE-2016-5195 "Dirty COW" fix while also keeping the
mitigation introduced in Owl earlier.  In the kernel build for x86-64,
bumped up the maximum number of logical CPUs from 32 to 96, enabled
support for NUMA, huge pages, hugetlbfs, modules for I2C and many
sensors (similar to what's enabled in RHEL) and CPU microcode update.

2016/10/23	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Added a mitigation for the "Dirty COW" Linux kernel privilege escalation
vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195).

2016/10/17 -
2016/10/21	Package: bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, active
Merged multiple DoS vulnerability fixes from Red Hat's package, most
notably for two easily triggerable assertion failures (CVE-2016-2776,
CVE-2016-2848).

2016/08/23	Package: openssh
Backported upstream fix for a use-after-free in sshd's debugging output,
with no known security impact.

2016/08/23	Package: openssl
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Updated to 1.0.0t, which fixes the "X509_ATTRIBUTE memory leak"
(CVE-2015-3195) and "Race condition handling PSK identify hint"
(CVE-2015-3196) vulnerabilities.  Neither of these affects the uses of
OpenSSL in Owl, but third-party applications using Owl's OpenSSL might
be affected.  The "high" impact potential is for the double-free
possibility mentioned in the OpenSSL advisory, even though the OpenSSL
team has rated the corresponding issue as "low" overall severity
(possibly considering its low risk probability, or/and other mitigating
factors).  This Owl package update also adds a CA certificate bundle.

2016/08/23	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local, active
Updated to 2.6.18-408.el5.028stab120.1, which addresses several DoS
vulnerabilities, and additionally fixed a kernel panic triggerable via
the move_pages() syscall.
Reference:

2016/08/23	Package: gnupg
SECURITY FIX	Severity: medium, remote, passive
Updated to 1.4.21, which, compared to 1.4.18, fixes side-channel leaks
(CVE-2014-3591, CVE-2015-0837) and a bug in the random number generator
where an attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG could trivially
predict the next 160 bits of output (CVE-2016-6313).

2016/07/20	Package: passwdqc
In version 1.3.1, fixed a bug in pam_passwdqc's rarely used "non-unix"
option.  The bug existed since passwdqc 1.1.3, released in 2009.

2015/08/01	Package: openssl
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, remote, passive to active
Updated to 1.0.0s, which fixes many Low and Moderate severity issues
(per OpenSSL's classification), as well as one High severity issue in
the client: silent downgrades of RSA to EXPORT_RSA (CVE-2015-0204), with
the corresponding attack known as FREAK.

2015/06/09	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Updated to 2.6.18-406.el5.028stab119.1.  Most importantly, this fixes a
possible I/O vector array overrun, which could allow for local privilege
escalation (CVE-2015-1805).

2015/03/06	Package: strace
Updated to 4.10.

2015/01/28	Package: glibc
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Backported upstream's fix for a buffer overflow in gethostbyname*()
functions, which could be triggered via a crafted IP address argument.
Depending on the application that uses these functions, this
vulnerability could allow a local or a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code.  Due to the analysis by Qualys (referenced below), it is
known that the issue could be exploited remotely via Exim (which we do
not include in Owl) or locally via clockdiff or procmail if these are
installed SUID/SGID or with filesystem capabilities (not the case on
Owl).  While there's no known security impact on Owl itself, Owl with
third-party software added (as many real-world installs have) may be
affected, with worst-case impact ranging up to a remote root compromise.

2015/01/26	Package: libnss
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, indirect, passive
Updated to 3.17.3. which includes a fix for "RSA PKCS#1 signature
verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm
parameter parsing" (CVE-2014-1568) since version 3.17.1.  The only part
potentially affected by this in Owl is RPM since it is the only package
using NSS currently, although we do not use RPM's signature verification
for Owl's own packages (we use GnuPG-signed mtree files instead).
