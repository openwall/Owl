This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.

Security fixes have a "Severity" specified for the issue(s) being fixed.
The three comma-separated metrics given after "Severity:" are: risk
impact (low, medium, or high), attack vector (local, remote, or
indirect), and whether the attack may be carried out at will (active) or
not (passive).  Please note that the specified risk impact is just that,
it is not the overall severity, so other metrics are not factored into
it.  For example, a "high" impact "local, passive" issue is generally of
lower overall severity than a "high" impact "remote, active" one - this
is left up to our users to consider given their specific circumstances.

Per our current conventions, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability is
generally considered to have a "low" risk impact (even if it is a
"remote, active" one, which is to be considered separately as it may
make the vulnerability fairly critical under specific circumstances).
Some examples of "medium" impact vulnerabilities would be persistent DoS
(where the DoS effect does not go away with a (sub)system restart), data
loss, bugs enabling non-critical information leaks, cryptographic
signature forgeries, and/or sending of or accepting spoofed/forged
network traffic (where such behavior was unexpected), as long as they
would not directly allow for a "high" impact attack.  Finally, a typical
"high" impact vulnerability would allow for privilege escalation such as
ability to execute code as another user ID than the attacker's (a
"local" attack) or without "legitimately" having such an ability (a
"remote" attack).

The metrics specified are generally those for a worst case scenario,
however in certain cases ranges such as "none to low" or/and "local to
remote" may be specified, referring to the defaults vs. a worst case yet
"legitimate" custom configuration.  In some complicated cases, multiple
issues or attacks may be dealt with at once.  When those differ in their
severity metrics, we use slashes to denote the possible combinations.
For example, "low/none to high, remote/local" means that we've dealt
with issue(s) or attack(s) that are "low, remote" and those that are
"none to high, local".  In those tricky cases, we generally try to
clarify the specific issue(s) and their severities in the description.


	Changes made between Owl 3.1 and Owl-current.

2015/08/01	Package: openssl
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, remote, passive to active
Updated to 1.0.0s, which fixes many Low and Moderate severity issues
(per OpenSSL's classification), as well as one High severity issue in
the client: silent downgrades of RSA to EXPORT_RSA (CVE-2015-0204), with
the corresponding attack known as FREAK.

2015/07/31	Package: bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, active
Merged multiple DoS vulnerability fixes from Red Hat's package, most
notably for the easily triggerable error in handling of TKEY queries
(CVE-2015-5477).

2015/06/11	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Fixed OpenVZ container filesystem (simfs) escape vulnerability via bind
mounts (CVE-2015-2925).

2015/06/09	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Updated to 2.6.18-406.el5.028stab119.1,  Most importantly, this fixes a
possible I/O vector array overrun, which could allow for local privilege
escalation (CVE-2015-1805).

2015/03/06	Package: strace
Updated to 4.10.

2015/01/28	Package: glibc
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Backported upstream's fix for a buffer overflow in gethostbyname*()
functions, which could be triggered via a crafted IP address argument.
Depending on the application that uses these functions, this
vulnerability could allow a local or a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code.  Due to the analysis by Qualys (referenced below), it is
known that the issue could be exploited remotely via Exim (which we do
not include in Owl) or locally via clockdiff or procmail if these are
installed SUID/SGID or with filesystem capabilities (not the case on
Owl).  While there's no known security impact on Owl itself, Owl with
third-party software added (as many real-world installs have) may be
affected, with worst-case impact ranging up to a remote root compromise.

2015/01/26	Package: libnss
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, indirect, passive
Updated to 3.17.3. which includes a fix for "RSA PKCS#1 signature
verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm
parameter parsing" (CVE-2014-1568) since version 3.17.1.  The only part
potentially affected by this in Owl is RPM since it is the only package
using NSS currently, although we do not use RPM's signature verification
for Owl's own packages (we use GnuPG-signed mtree files instead).

Leak" (CVE-2014-3567), and adds support for "SSL 3.0 Fallback
