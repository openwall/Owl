The Owl homepage is:

http://www.openwall.com/Owl/

Owl can be downloaded from the following official mirrors:

ftp://ftp.ca.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Canada)
ftp://ftp.pl.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Poland)
ftp://ftp.ru.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Russia)
ftp://ftp.ua.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Ukraine)
ftp://ftp.cz.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Czech Republic)
ftp://ftp.wiretapped.net/pub/Owl/	(Australia)

There's a subdirectory for each Owl release or branch, with the
following contents:

native.tar.gz		CVS tree (build specifications and patches)
sources			source tree (original tarballs, etc)
Owl.mtree		mtree(8) specification of the above
kernel			kernel sources and recommended patches
i386, sparc, sparcv9	Owl binary packages

The mtree(8) specifications for Owl releases are PGP signed.  The
corresponding PGP public key is available from:

http://www.openwall.com/signatures/

You will always need the CVS tree, -- even if you choose to install
binary packages only.  In order to (re-)build Owl from source, you'll
need both the CVS and the source trees.

More documentation (including BUILD and INSTALL) is available in the
CVS tree, under Owl/doc/.
