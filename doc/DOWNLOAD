The Owl homepage is:

http://www.openwall.com/Owl/

Owl can be downloaded from the following official mirrors:

ftp://ftp1.ru.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Russia, Russian Express ISP)
ftp://ftp2.ru.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Russia, DataForce ISP)
ftp://ftp.pl.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Poland)
ftp://ftp.ua.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Ukraine)
ftp://ftp.cz.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Czech Republic)
ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/opsys/linux/Owl/	(Austria)

	rsync://gd.tuwien.ac.at/opsys/linux/Owl/
ftp://ftp.ca.openwall.com/pub/Owl/	(Canada)
ftp://ftp.wiretapped.net/pub/Owl/	(Australia)

There's a subdirectory for each Owl release or branch, with the
following contents:

native.tar.gz		CVS tree (build specifications and patches)
sources			source tree (original tarballs, etc)
kernel			kernel sources and recommended patches
Owl.mtree		mtree(8) specification of the above
i?86, sparc*, alpha*	Owl binary packages
iso			ISO-9660 images of Owl CD's

Some of the subdirectories may use symlinks to files common to several
Owl branches.  Thus, to download just one Owl branch you may need to
tell your FTP client to dereference symlinks.  With lftp (which is a
part of Owl), use the "mirror -L" command.

The mtree(8) specifications for Owl releases are PGP signed.  The
corresponding PGP public key is available from:

http://www.openwall.com/signatures/

You will always need the CVS tree, -- even if you choose to install
binary packages only.  In order to (re-)build Owl from source, you'll
need both the CVS and the source trees.

More documentation (including BUILD and INSTALL) is available in the
CVS tree, under Owl/doc/.
