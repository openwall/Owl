This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.

Security fixes have a "Severity" specified for the issue(s) being fixed.
The three comma-separated metrics given after "Severity:" are: risk
impact (low, medium, or high), attack vector (local, remote, or
indirect), and whether the attack may be carried out at will (active) or
not (passive).  Please note that the specified risk impact is just that,
it is not the overall severity, so other metrics are not factored into
it.  For example, a "high" impact "local, passive" issue is generally of
lower overall severity than a "high" impact "remote, active" one - this
is left up to our users to consider given their specific circumstances.

Per our current conventions, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability is
generally considered to have a "low" risk impact (even if it is a
"remote, active" one, which is to be considered separately as it may
make the vulnerability fairly critical under specific circumstances).
Some examples of "medium" impact vulnerabilities would be bugs enabling
non-critical information leaks, cryptographic signature forgeries,
and/or sending of or accepting spoofed/forged network traffic (where
such behavior was unexpected), as long as they would not directly allow
for a "high" impact attack.  Finally, a typical "high" impact
vulnerability would allow for privilege escalation such as ability to
execute code as another user ID than the attacker's (a "local" attack)
or without "legitimately" having such an ability (a "remote" attack).

The metrics specified are generally those for a worst case scenario,
however in certain cases ranges such as "none to low" or/and "local to
remote" may be specified, referring to the defaults vs. a worst case yet
"legitimate" custom configuration.  In some complicated cases, multiple
issues or attacks may be dealt with at once.  When those differ in their
severity metrics, we use slashes to denote the possible combinations.
For example, "low/none to high, remote/local" means that we've dealt
with issue(s) or attack(s) that are "low, remote" and those that are
"none to high, local".  In those tricky cases, we generally try to
clarify the specific issue(s) and their severities in the description.


	Changes made between Owl 2.0 and Owl-current.

2010/09/24	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "RHEL5 testing" branch
(2.6.18-194.11.3.el5.028stab071.5).  Added a fix for the
compat_alloc_user_space() function missing sanity checks (CVE-2010-3081)
from OpenVZ's 028stab070.5 (the same as Red Hat's from their -194.11.4
RHEL5 kernel).  This was a "local root" vulnerability on 64-bit kernels
built with 32-bit compatibility enabled.

2010/09/21	Package: grep
Updated to 2.7.

2010/09/21	Package: bzip2
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, passive
Updated to 1.0.6.  This release fixes an integer overflow vulnerability
discovered by Mikolaj Izdebski in the BZ2_decompress function in
bzip2/libbz2.  An attacker could use the vulnerability to crash bzip2 or
an application using libbz2 or potentially to execute arbitrary code via
a crafted "bzip2-compressed" file.

2010/09/02 -
2010/09/18	Package: pam_mktemp
Revised pam_mktemp in multiple ways mostly relevant to (re)uses of this
module on systems other than Owl.

2010/09/06	Package: rpm
Backported xz/lzma support for Source and Patch files, as well as for
package payloads.

2010/09/06	Package: xz
New package: data compression library and a set of gzip-style tools for
working with files compressed with the Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm
(LZMA).  It supports two formats: .xz and the older .lzma format.

2010/09/06	Package: lftp
Updated to 4.0.10.

2010/09/01 -
2010/09/03	Packages: openssh, owl-cdrom, owl-dev, owl-setup,
		owl-startup, rpm, iputils
Assorted minor improvements have been made and/or bugfixes applied to
these Owl packages (as usual, more detail is available in the packages'
change logs).

2010/08/30 -
2010/09/03	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low to high, local, active
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "RHEL5 testing" branch
(2.6.18-194.11.3.el5.028stab071.3), applied some additional bugfixes,
and of course preserved our usual changes.  Enabled CONFIG_FUSION_* and
CONFIG_PCNET32 (as modules) for easier Owl installation into VMware and
VirtualBox VMs.

2010/07/28	Package: postfix
Updated to 2.4.14.

2010/07/28	Package: openssh
The SSH client will now use protocol 2 by default (finally).

2010/07/27	Packages: owl-startup, modutils
/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit has been enhanced and corrected in numerous ways:
it will disable the console screensaver (such that datacenter staff may
see the last console messages without connecting a keyboard or even if
the system freezes), distinguish more kinds of fsck exit codes and act
accordingly, and use "depmod -A" instead of "depmod -a" (to avoid
rebuilding of kernel module dependencies unnecessarily).  The default
/etc/sysctl.conf will now explicitly set vm.mmap_min_addr to a
reasonable non-zero value (currently 96 KB), not relying on the kernel
to have a similar default anymore (although our kernel does).

2010/07/19 -
2010/07/28	Packages: owl-setup, owl-etc, owl-hier;
		Owl/build/install{iso,vz}tree.sh
Added ext4 filesystem support - in fact, "settle" (the Owl installer
program) will now offer ext4 by default, with ext3 and ext2 still
available as non-default per-filesystem choices.  Made the menus,
prompts, and messages of both "settle" and "setup" hopefully more
intuitive by clearly indicating which steps are optional, required, or
recommended (and the like), having a bit fewer menu items (where some
could be dropped or replaced without a loss of functionality for any of
our users), revising menu item names and hint messages, and offering
likely-correct inputs as defaults.  Revised the console font/map presets
for Cyrillic and Western European encodings.  Almost all on-disk
filesystems are now mounted with "noatime" by default (for better
performance), and a /sys mountpoint and fstab entry (for sysfs) are now
created by default (with "noauto").

2010/07/24	Package: owl-cdrom
Revised the LILO boot menu, leaving only two boot targets: "normal" and
"rescue".  This makes use of the new kernel's boot CD/DVD drive device
autodetection.  Revised the "welcome" script to reflect other changes,
and enhanced it in numerous minor ways.

2010/07/17 -
2010/07/21	Packages: kernel, lilo, owl-cdrom, owl-setup;
		Owl/build/{install*.sh,Makefile}; Owl/doc/*
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their rhel5 branch
(2.6.18-194.8.1.el5.028stab070.2) with minor additional changes in Owl.
As usual, this kernel version contains a number of security fixes
(mostly backports made by Red Hat).  The security impact of
CVE-2010-0291 ("mremap/mmap mess"), if any, on x86 and x86-64 systems is
difficult to determine.  The remaining issues fixed were NULL pointer
dereferences (the impact of which had been reduced to a DoS due to
vm.mmap_min_addr) and/or were in kernel subsystems not built on Owl by
default.  At the same time with making this update, the kernel has been
RPM-packaged, but in a way allowing for easy non-packaged builds as well
(there are only two cumulative patch files).  AHCI vs. Marvell PATA
driver co-existence fixes have been backported from Linux 2.6.34.1.
Boot CD/DVD drive device autodetection has been implemented (needed to
locate the root filesystem when booting off a CD/DVD with LILO).  ext4
filesystem support has been enabled.

2010/06/14	Package: john
Updated to 1.7.6, including usability improvements relevant to the Owl
package of John the Ripper.

2010/06/07	Package: tcb
Updated to 1.0.6.

2010/05/04	Package: lftp
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, remote, passive
Updated to 4.0.7.  This changes the default behavior of lftp(1) and the
lftpget(1) script to no longer trust and use a possible server-provided
filename instead of the user-specified download filename.

2010/04/14	Package: strace
Updated to 4.5.20.

2010/03/27	Package: passwdqc
In passwdqc 1.2.1, a password strength check has been adjusted to no
longer subject certain passwords that start with a digit and/or end with
a capital letter to an unintentionally stricter policy.

2010/03/22	kernel;
		Owl/build/buildkernel.sh;
		Package: owl-cdrom
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "rhel5" branch
(2.6.18-164.11.1.el5.028stab068.5 released on 2010/03/18) with Red Hat's
patches up to 2.6.18-164.15.1.el5 added (apparently prepared by Red Hat
on 2010/03/01, released and announced on 2010/03/16), and with some
minor changes of our own.  We call the resulting kernel version
2.6.18-164.15.1.el5.028stab068.5-owl1.  Compared to earlier "rhel5"
kernels, this update fixes a large number of vulnerabilities of varying
impact in various kernel subsystems, which may or may not have been
exposed in specific circumstances.

2010/03/11 -
2010/03/21	Packages: tar, cpio
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, indirect, passive
Updated tar to 1.23, which includes a fix for the heap-based buffer
overflow in the rmt client functionality (CVE-2010-0624), and applied
a fix for the same vulnerability to cpio.  The attack would require
either that an rmt server being used by tar or cpio on purpose is
compromised first (by other means) or that these tools are fooled into
accessing a malicious rmt server, such as via having them run on a
malicious filename.  The latter risk was mitigated by tar's default to
use ssh for the --rsh-command and by ssh defaulting to asking the user
before accepting an unrecognized host key.  In cpio's case, it was
mitigated by cpio requiring the --rsh-command option to use rmt.  With
our update to tar, we have also patched it to require its --rsh-command
option to use rmt (just like cpio does), and we applied a number of
post-release fixes for regressions introduced in the 1.23 release.

2010/01/28	Owl/build/{Makefile,installworld.conf,installworld.sh,
		installvztree.sh,makevztemplate.sh}
Implemented "make vztemplate" - a make target to easily generate OpenVZ
container templates of the Owl userland.  The resulting templates may be
used on Owl and/or on other Linux systems with OpenVZ.

2010/01/24 -
2010/01/28	Package: nmap
Updated to 5.21 with our usual enhancements for privilege reduction.

2010/01/21 -
2010/01/26	Package: pciutils
Updated to 3.1.6.

2010/01/20	Package: gzip
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, indirect, passive
Applied upstream's fix for an integer underflow leading to an array
index error in the way gzip used to decompress data compressed with the
Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm.  An attacker could provide
a specially-crafted LZW-compressed gzip archive, which once decompressed
by an unsuspecting user on a 64-bit system would lead to a gzip crash or
potentially to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running gzip.

John the Ripper has been enhanced in numerous ways, bringing it up to
version 1.7.4.2.  Functionality and performance of the word mangling
rules engine have been improved, the default rulesets and the bundled
common passwords list have been revised, performance with very large
password files or sets of files has been improved, idle priority has
been enabled by default.

2009/11/30	Package: libtool
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, passive
Applied upstream's backport of libltdl changes from the libtool 2.26b
release: no longer attempt to dlopen() the old_library listed in .la
files, and do not open module.la files from the current directory.
No Owl packages use libltdl and therefore none are vulnerable, but
third-party software could be abused by e.g. creating a malicious .la
file and tricking a privileged user into executing a libltdl-based
application in the same directory.

		Owl/build/buildworld.sh;
		Owl/doc/{ARCHITECTURES,BUILD}
On 32-bit x86, packages are now built for the i686 architecture flavor
by default.

2009/11/20 -
2009/11/23	kernel;
		Owl/build/buildkernel.sh;
		Packages: owl-cdrom, procps, util-linux
The default kernel has been replaced with OpenVZ's latest from their
"rhel5" branch, with some modifications of our own (mostly for better
compatibility with the Owl userland, as well as for security).
Formally, this was forked off Linux 2.6.18 (originally by Red Hat), but
the changes are so extensive that this is actually an up-to-date kernel
branch/version on its own, including Red Hat's backports of security
fixes (and a lot more) and OpenVZ's container-based virtualization.
This kernel branch is currently maintained by both Red Hat (for RHEL5)
and OpenVZ.  The specific version number we're currently using is
2.6.18-128.2.1.el5.028stab064.8-owl0.2.

2009/11/20	Package: gcc;
		Owl/build/{installorder.conf,installworld.sh}
Dropped two older libstdc++-*-compat subpackages, which were providing
binary compatibility for C++ programs built with gcc 2.x.

2009/11/20	Package: ipchains;
		Owl/build/installorder.conf
Dropped package: ipchains has been obsoleted by iptables for years, but
we kept it in Owl to ease transition of existing systems from Linux 2.2
to Linux 2.4 kernels (which still included optional kernel support for
ipchains).  Now that we're dropping support for Linux 2.4, it is also
high time to drop ipchains, so we did.  iptables, the replacement, has
been a part of Owl for years.

2009/11/18	Package: diffstat
Updated to 1.51.

2009/11/18	Package: vsftpd
Updated to 2.2.2.

2009/11/17	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.7-ow1.  The 2.4.37.7 kernel fixes a number of
security-related bugs.

2009/10/25	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.6-ow1.  The 2.4.37.6 kernel fixes a number of
information leak vulnerabilities.  One of these was already fixed in
2.4.37.5-ow1, and the remaining ones may or may not affect specific
systems depending on both kernel and userspace configuration.

2009/10/10	Packages: pam, pam_passwdqc, passwdqc;
		Owl/build/installorder.conf
The pam_passwdqc package has been replaced with passwdqc, a new package,
which includes pam_passwdqc(8) (the PAM module), libpasswdqc
(a password/passphrase strength checking library), pwqcheck(1)
(a standalone password/passphrase strength checking program), and
pwqgen(1) (a standalone random passphrase generator program).

2009/08/23	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high/medium, local, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.5-ow1.  The 2.4.37.5 kernel adds a fix for the
"Linux NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect proto_ops
initializations", which on Owl was not exploitable into privilege
escalation on its own due to the vm.mmap_min_addr feature, as long as
the latter was enabled and working (there have been no known issues with
it in recent kernels).  In our patched kernels, vm.mmap_min_addr is
enabled by default.  Additionally, our default kernels did not include
support for any socket types via which the bug is known to be
triggerable.  More importantly, Linux 2.4.37.5-ow1 adds a fix for the
sigaltstack local information leak affecting 64-bit kernel builds.

2009/08/22	Package: rpm
Introduced the configure-presets script, which pre-defines a bunch of
autoconf variables in order to achieve more deterministic and slightly
quicker builds.  Most importantly, this makes the configure scripts of
many other packages assume the presence of certain security-relevant
interfaces (fail-close behavior) rather than auto-detect those and
possibly fallback to other interfaces (fail-open behavior).  The
configure-presets script is automatically "sourced" before the %build
section commands are invoked (including when our rpmbuild(8) is used to
build third-party packages), and it may also be explicitly "sourced" for
manual builds of autoconf'ed software by Owl users.

2009/08/17	Package: tar
Updated to 1.22.90, which replaces most of our error handling fixes
originally implemented in the Owl package of tar in Nov-Dec 2008 with
more elaborate changes by Sergey Poznyakoff.  Dropped the
--ignore-device-id option in favor of its official name of
--no-check-device.

Corrected pdfroff(1) to create temporary files in a safe manner and to
invoke gs(1) (Ghostscript) with the -dSAFER option to make it treat the
input file as untrusted.  pdfroff had been introduced into Owl with the
groff update on 2009/08/06.  Before getting corrected, the temporary
files issue was mitigated by pdfroff's use of the TMPDIR environment
variable, which our pam_mktemp module sets to point to the user's
private directory.  Additionally, for pdfroff to work and for the lack
of the -dSAFER option to come into play, one would need to install
Ghostscript first, which was not a part of Owl.  Besides fixing pdfroff,
we have identified and patched numerous relatively minor temporary file
handling issues in other components of the new version of groff.  Thanks
to brian m. carlson for identifying and reporting the two pdfroff issues
to Debian.

2009/07/28	Package: bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, active
Backported upstream fix for a remote DoS bug: by sending a specially
crafted dynamic update packet to a BIND server, a remote unauthenticated
attacker could cause the server to crash.  According to the ISC and to
our own testing, this vulnerability affects servers that are masters for
one or more zones - it is not limited to those that are configured to
allow dynamic updates.  Our default BIND configuration includes several
master zones, such as 127.in-addr.arpa, which are usable for the attack.
BIND's own access controls (such as the "allow-query" directive) are
ineffective against the attack.

2009/07/20	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local to remote, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.3-ow1.  The 2.4.37.3 kernel release adds the
"-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks" option to gcc invocations, which is
important to reduce the impact of a class of kernel bugs (which are yet
to be found and fixed individually, but are known to exist in general),
adds several security-relevant fixes to the RTL-8169 NIC driver, and
makes other assorted changes.  The Linux 2.4.37.3-ow1 kernel patch
introduces an additional security hardening measure where the kernel
will no longer allow the "personality" feature (which is needed to
support some program binaries from other operating systems) to be abused
to bypass the vm.mmap_min_addr restriction via SUID-root programs with a
certain class of design errors in them.  Similar changes were introduced
into 2.6.x kernels recently.

2009/07/15	Package: dhcp
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, remote, active
Updated to 3.0.7.  Fixed the DHCP server premature termination bug when
receiving certain well-formed DHCP requests, provided that the server
configuration mixes host definitions using "dhcp-client-identifier" and
"hardware ethernet".  It has not been fully researched whether the bug
had any impact on versions 3.0.x of the DHCP server, and there is a
specific reason why it might not have had any impact, yet we're fixing
the underlying bug.  Discovery and patch by Christoph Biedl.

2009/07/07	Package: openssh
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Backported upstream fix for a syslog call inside a signal handler.  The
security impact this issue might have had was not fully evaluated.  On
Debian systems, the reported impact was processes getting stuck on locks
inside glibc.  On Owl, no problems were ever reported, yet the call was
unsafe, with the worst-case impact being arbitrary code execution
(depending on processing inside glibc).

2008/11/02	Package: tar
Updated to 1.20.

2008/08/14	Package: postfix
Updated to 2.4.8, disabled the Solaris symlink hack that allowed local
mail deliveries through "root-owned" symlinks.  Although this is a
security update for some other systems, on Owl the problem was avoided
or mitigated in several ways:
- we have a patch, introduced prior to Owl 2.0, that adds the
local_minimum_uid setting with a default of 500 - preventing local mail
deliveries to user "root" (unless it is correctly setup as an alias to
some other e-mail address), as well as to other system special accounts;
- there's no potential attack vector to get group "mail" privileges on
Owl with no third-party software added - no single program is installed
SGID "mail";
- the mail spool directory is only writable by root and group "mail"
(not world-writable), yet it has the sticky bit set (mode 1771), which
prevents the attack for already-existing mailboxes;
- "useradd -m", which must be used to create a user account with a home
directory, also pre-creates the mailbox;
- our default kernel includes the CONFIG_HARDEN_LINK option, enabled by
default, which thwarts the hardlink-to-symlink attack.
