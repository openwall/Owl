This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 2.0 and Owl-current.

2008/01/01	Package: gnupg
Updated to 1.4.8.

2008/01/01	Package: e2fsprogs
Updated to 1.40.4.

2007/12/16	Package: postfix
Updated to 2.4.6.

2007/12/06	Package: e2fsprogs
Applied upstream patch to fix integer overflows in libext2fs.
This addresses a potential vulnerability where an untrusted filesystem
can be corrupted on purpose in such a way that a program using libext2fs
will allocate a buffer that is far too small.  This can lead to either a
crash or potentially a heap-based buffer overflow.
Thanks to Rafal Wojtczuk of McAfee Avert Labs for reporting this issue.

2007/09/24	Package: pcre
Updated to 7.4.

2007/08/30	Package: vim
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, indirect, passive
Backported upstream fix to restrict dangerous functions in modelines.
Note that vim's modelines have always been disabled on Owl by default
(with a setting in /usr/share/vim/vimrc) and even this fix is no guarantee
modelines will be safe to use or the restricted mode safe to rely upon
in the future.
Backported upstream fix for format string vulnerability in the
helptags_one function, which allowed user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a help-tags tag
in a help file.

2007/08/18	kernel
Updated to Linux 2.4.35-ow2.  The single known security-relevant change
added with Linux 2.4.35 is correction of the randomness pool update bug
discovered by the PaX Team.  The -ow2 revision adds a fix for the parent
process death signal bug in the Linux kernel discovered by Wojciech
Purczynski of COSEINC PTE Ltd. and iSEC Security Research; this bug has
no security impact on Owl with no added SUID programs.  Also added are
two security hardening features, both enabled by default: restricted
access to VM86 mode (specific to 32-bit x86) and restricted zero page
mappings (generic).

name servers.  The weakness used to make it easier for remote attackers
to guess the next query id and perform DNS cache poisoning.

2007/06/01	Package: owl-cdrom
In the default kernel for x86, enabled more IDE chipset drivers, common
RAID and SATA controller drivers, USB and HID support (keyboard, mouse,

SECURITY FIX	Severity: medium, indirect, passive
Updated to 1.4.7.  This includes a fix for an unsigned data injection
vulnerability:
An attacker is able to add arbitrary content to a signed message, and
the receiver of the message may not be able to distinguish the forged
and the properly signed parts of the message.

2007/02/25	Package: openssl
Updated to 0.9.7m.

2007/01/29	Package: bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, active
Updated to 9.3.4, which fixes two security issues.
The first issue is a "use after free" vulnerability which allowed remote
DoS attack via unspecified vectors that cause BIND to "dereference (read)
a freed fetch context".
The second issue allowed remote DoS attack via a type ANY DNS query
response that contains multiple RR sets in the answer section, which
triggers an assertion error if DNSSEC validation is enabled.
