This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.
