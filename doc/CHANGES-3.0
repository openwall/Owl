This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 2.0 and Owl-current.

2009/07/28	Package: bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, remote, active
Backport upstream fix for a remote DoS bug: by sending a specially
crafted dynamic update packet to a BIND server, a remote unauthenticated
attacker can cause it to crash.

2009/07/20	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local to remote, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.3-ow1.  The 2.4.37.3 kernel release adds the
"-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks" option to gcc invocations, which is
important to reduce the impact of a class of kernel bugs (which are yet
to be found and fixed individually, but are known to exist in general),
adds several security-relevant fixes to the RTL-8169 NIC driver, and
makes other assorted changes.  The Linux 2.4.37.3-ow1 kernel patch
introduces an additional security hardening measure where the kernel
would no longer allow the "personality" feature (which is needed to
support some program binaries from other operating systems) to be abused
to bypass the vm.mmap_min_addr restriction via SUID-root programs with a
certain class of design errors in them.  Similar changes were introduced
into 2.6.x kernels recently.

2009/07/18 -
2009/07/19	Package: vsftpd
Updated to 2.2.0pre4, which officially reverts the default for "listen"
back to NO (the way we had it in Owl all the time) and implements the
"-o" option (the syntax and semantics are subtly different from what we
had in our own implementation).

2009/07/16 -
2009/07/19	Package: nmap
Updated to 5.00 with our usual enhancements for privilege reduction and
with some post-release fixes.  Enabled build of Ncat (an even more
powerful remake of the well-known netcat tool, which we previously had
represented in Owl with OpenBSD's remake) and build of Nmap with NSE
(Nmap Scripting Engine) support enabled.  Ncat gets into its own binary
subpackage called "ncat" and installable independently of "nmap".

2009/07/15	Package: dhcp
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, remote, active
Updated to 3.0.7.  Fixed the DHCP server premature termination bug when
receiving certain well-formed DHCP requests, provided that the server
configuration mixes host definitions using "dhcp-client-identifier" and
"hardware ethernet".  It has not been fully researched whether the bug
had any impact on versions 3.0.x of the DHCP server, and there is a
specific reason why it might not have had any impact, yet we're fixing
the underlying bug.  Discovery and patch by Christoph Biedl.

2009/07/08	Package: chkconfig
Updated to 1.3.38.

2009/07/07	kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.2-ow1.  The 2.4.37.2 kernel release adds several
bug fixes, including security-relevant ones.
Reference:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/ChangeLog-2.4.37.2

2009/07/07	Package: openssh
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Backported upstream fix for a syslog call inside a signal handler.  The
security impact this issue might have had was not fully evaluated.  On
Debian systems, the reported impact was processes getting stuck on locks
inside glibc.  On Owl, no problems were ever reported, yet the call was
unsafe, with the worst-case impact being arbitrary code execution
(depending on processing inside glibc).

2009/07/05	Package: man-pages
Updated to 3.21.

2009/06/17	Package: dmidecode;
		Owl/build/installorder.conf
New package: dmidecode reports information about x86 & x86-64 hardware
as described in the system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard.

2009/06/10	Package: pciutils;
		Owl/build/installorder.conf
New package: pciutils contains utilities for inspecting and setting up
devices connected to the PCI bus.

2009/05/27 -
2009/05/29	Package: vsftpd
Updated to 2.1.1, keeping the default at listen=NO (overriding
upstream's change of default).  Added the new option "-o", which can be
used to specify configuration settings via the command line.

2009/05/27	Package: pcre
Updated to 7.9.

2009/05/25	Package: patchutils
Updated to 0.3.1.

2009/05/24	kernel; Package: owl-cdrom
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.37.1-ow1.  In the default kernels for x86 and
x86-64, enabled SCSI generic support (as needed for CD/DVD recording),
UDF filesystem support (read-only), and more SATA and NIC drivers.
Linux 2.4.37.1, compared to 2.4.35-ow2, adds numerous security-relevant
fixes to various kernel subsystems.

2009/05/24	Package: diffstat
Updated to 1.47.

2009/05/06 -
2009/05/22	Packages: cdrkit, mkisofs, owl-dev;
		Owl/build/installorder.conf
New package: cdrkit is a suite of programs for recording CDs and DVDs,
blanking CD-RW media, creating ISO-9660 filesystem images, extracting
audio CD data, and more.  This obsoletes our mkisofs source package,
which was directly based on cdrtools (of which cdrkit is a fork).

2009/05/21	Package: nmap
Updated to 4.76.

2009/05/15	Package: libnids
Updated to 1.23.

2009/05/09	Package: hdparm
Updated to 9.15.

2009/05/02	Package: e2fsprogs
Updated to 1.41.5.

2009/04/08	Package: tcb
In the new version 1.0.3 of the tcb package, child processes spawned by
pam_tcb will now always use _exit(2) rather than exit(3) to avoid
triggering side effects.  When changing passwords, pam_tcb will now
fsync(2) the temporary file prior to renaming it over the actual shadow
file, as needed on filesystems with not entirely atomic rename(2) (XFS).
Thanks to Pascal Terjan of Mandriva and to Ermanno Scaglione for
reporting these two issues, respectively.

2009/03/06	Package: bind
Dropped the root-delegation-only directive from the default named
configuration because the list of TLDs that are not delegation-only was
incomplete and wouldn't be maintained/updated on all installs, causing
some DNS lookups of valid records to fail.
Reference:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=217829

2009/02/06	Package: bind
Dropped DNSSEC support, which is not useful on the Internet at large
yet.  Those who wish to experiment with DNSSEC at their own risk may
set BUILD_OPENSSL to 1 and rebuild the package.

2009/01/08	Packages: openssl, bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: medium, remote, passive
Backported upstream fixes for multiple OpenSSL signature verification
API misuses.

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5077

2008/11/02	Package: tar
Updated to 1.20.

2008/08/14	Package: postfix
Updated to 2.4.8, disabled the Solaris symlink hack that allowed local
mail deliveries through "root-owned" symlinks.  Although this is a
security update for some other systems, on Owl the problem was avoided
or mitigated in several ways:
- we have a patch, introduced prior to Owl 2.0, that adds the
local_minimum_uid setting with a default of 500 - preventing local mail
deliveries to user "root" (unless it is correctly setup as an alias to
some other e-mail address), as well as to other system special accounts;
- there's no potential attack vector to get group "mail" privileges on
Owl with no third-party software added - no single program is installed
SGID "mail";
- the mail spool directory is only writable by root and group "mail"
(not world-writable), yet it has the sticky bit set (mode 1771), which
prevents the attack for already-existing mailboxes;
- "useradd -m", which must be used to create a user account with a home
directory, also pre-creates the mailbox;
- our default kernel includes the CONFIG_HARDEN_LINK option, enabled by
default, which thwarts the hardlink-to-symlink attack.

2008/08/10	Package: bind
Updated to 9.3.5-P2, added an OpenBSD-derived patch to implement
support for more than 1024 simultaneous recursive queries.

2006/09/13 -
2008/07/10	Package: john
Many updates to John the Ripper have been made, bringing it to version
1.7.3.  Most notably, two Blowfish-based crypt(3) hashes may now be
computed in parallel for much better performance on x86-64 CPUs.  Also,
"DumbForce" and "KnownForce" external mode samples have been added to
the default john.conf.

2008/07/08	Package: bind
SECURITY FIX	Severity: medium, remote, active
Updated to 9.3.5-P1, which additionally randomizes UDP query ports to
improve resilience to DNS cache poisoning attacks.

2008/06/29	Package: vsftpd
Updated to 2.0.6.

2008/05/27	Package: openssh
Implemented support for RSA/DSA key blacklisting in sshd based on
partial fingerprints, added a subpackage with blacklisted 48-bit partial
fingerprints for 1024-bit and 2048-bit RSA and 1024-bit DSA keys as
generated on vulnerable Debian, Ubuntu, and derived systems for PID
range 1 to 32767.  Due to the encoding scheme used, the blacklist file
size is just 1.3 MB, which corresponds to less than 4.5 bytes per
fingerprint.  This effort was supported by CivicActions.  References:

2008/02/13	Package: pcre
Updated to 7.6.

2008/02/12	Packages: pam_passwdqc, pam
Applied numerous minor changes to pam_passwdqc and its default settings,
including replacing its set of separator characters (used for randomly
generated "passphrases") with some of those defined by RFC 3986 as being
safe within "userinfo" part of URLs without encoding, reducing the
default minimum length for passphrases from 12 to 11, and corrections to
the documentation.

2008/01/15	Package: tar
Added a new option: --ignore-device-id, to be used when creating
incremental dumps off filesystems with volatile device numbers, such as
OpenVZ simfs.

2008/01/04	Package: hdparm
Updated to 7.7.

2008/01/01	Package: gnupg
Updated to 1.4.8.

2008/01/01	Package: e2fsprogs
Updated to 1.40.4.

2007/12/16	Package: postfix
Updated to 2.4.6.

2007/12/06	Package: e2fsprogs
Applied upstream patch to fix integer overflows in libext2fs.
This addresses a potential vulnerability where an untrusted filesystem
can be corrupted on purpose in such a way that a program using libext2fs
will allocate a buffer that is far too small.  This can lead to either a
crash or potentially a heap-based buffer overflow.
Thanks to Rafal Wojtczuk of McAfee Avert Labs for reporting this issue.

2007/08/30	Package: vim
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, indirect, passive
Backported upstream fix to restrict dangerous functions in modelines.
Note that vim's modelines have always been disabled on Owl by default
(with a setting in /usr/share/vim/vimrc) and even this fix is no guarantee
modelines will be safe to use or the restricted mode safe to rely upon
in the future.
Backported upstream fix for format string vulnerability in the
helptags_one function, which allowed user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a help-tags tag
in a help file.

2007/08/18	kernel
Updated to Linux 2.4.35-ow2.  The single known security-relevant change
added with Linux 2.4.35 is correction of the randomness pool update bug
discovered by the PaX Team.  The -ow2 revision adds a fix for the parent
process death signal bug in the Linux kernel discovered by Wojciech
Purczynski of COSEINC PTE Ltd. and iSEC Security Research; this bug has
no security impact on Owl with no added SUID programs.  Also added are
two security hardening features, both enabled by default: restricted
access to VM86 mode (specific to 32-bit x86) and restricted zero page
mappings (generic).

SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, active
Updated to 9.3.4, which fixes two security issues.
The first issue is a "use after free" vulnerability which allowed remote
