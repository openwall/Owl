This is the public Owl to-do list.  Currently, it contains a few tasks
left over from Owl 3.0 release preparations (these tasks were not taken
care of in time for the release).


Bring the documentation translations in sync with English or drop them.

Start to implement security hardening of OpenVZ kernels.

Replace our hybrid 2.4+2.6 modutils with plain module-init-tools.

User's Guide - review and edit the draft, identify and add important
missing chapters (adding/removing users, managing OpenVZ containers,
maybe something else).
