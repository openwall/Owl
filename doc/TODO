This is the public Owl to-do list.


	Owl 4.0 roadmap (lists only tasks that are not completed yet).

Support a package repository, possibly with Zypper, yum, or apt (package
one of these - and its prerequisites).

Toolchain and libraries updates (gcc, glibc, OpenSSL, etc.)  Package
updates that we didn't dare to make shortly before 3.0 (OpenSSH, etc.)

Packages to consider and likely add (second batch, after toolchain and
libraries update): tcpdump (or tshark?), up to two newbie-friendly text
and hex editor(s) (consider: nano, le, dhex, beye), wget (or put it in
the repository only).

PPP/PPPoE/PPTP support (add userland packages).

Full LAMP stack in base system (add Apache, PHP, MySQL).

With the LAMP stack added, we will have to start requiring DVD media
(will exceed 700 MB CD-R), exclude source code from (some of) our ISOs,
or start using a compressed filesystem.

UTF-8 support.  In Owl 3.0, we have building of UTF-8 locales disabled
in glibc.spec by default, and we have UTF-8 support disabled when
building other packages (e.g., Mutt).  This saves us from some security
issues being discovered (that affect other distributions but not us),
but perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and support UTF-8 by default.

Move to OpenVZ's RHEL6 branch kernels.

IPv6 support (networking startup scripts, installer, default kernel
config).  Need to get the networking scripts replaced first (Simon?)

Replace LILO with Syslinux (ISOLINUX, EXTLINUX).

Add a GPT-aware disk partitioning tool (parted?), make it available
from the installer.


	Tasks left over from Owl 3.0 release preparations.

Bring the documentation translations in sync with English or drop them.
(French and German were in fact dropped from 3.0, but kept in -current
for now.  Maybe drop them from -current as well.)

Proceed to implement security hardening of OpenVZ kernels.

Replace our hybrid 2.4+2.6 modutils with plain module-init-tools.

User's Guide - review and edit the draft, make it public, then identify
and add important missing chapters (adding/removing users, managing
OpenVZ containers, maybe something else).
