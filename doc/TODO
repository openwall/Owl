This is the public Owl to-do list.


	Owl 4.0 roadmap.

Support a package repository, likely with Zypper (package it):
http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Zypper

Toolchain and libraries updates (gcc, glibc, OpenSSL, etc.)  Package
updates that we didn't dare to make shortly before 3.0 (OpenSSH, etc.)

Packages to consider and likely add (first batch): vlan.
(Already added: ethtool, pv, bridge-utils, usbutils.)

Packages to consider and likely add (second batch, after toolchain and
libraries update): tcpdump (or tshark?), nano (or another
newbie-friendly text editor), wget (or put it in the repository only).

ICMP sockets.

Move to OpenVZ's RHEL6 branch kernels.

IPv6 support (networking startup scripts, installer, default kernel
config).  Need to get the networking scripts replaced first (Simon?)

Replace LILO with Syslinux (ISOLINUX, EXTLINUX).

Add a GPT-aware disk partitioning tool (parted?), make it available
from the installer.


	Tasks left over from Owl 3.0 release preparations.

Bring the documentation translations in sync with English or drop them.
(French and German were in fact dropped from 3.0, but kept in -current
for now.  Maybe drop them from -current as well.)

Proceed to implement security hardening of OpenVZ kernels.

Replace our hybrid 2.4+2.6 modutils with plain module-init-tools.

User's Guide - review and edit the draft, make it public, then identify
and add important missing chapters (adding/removing users, managing
OpenVZ containers, maybe something else).
