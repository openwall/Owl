This is the public Owl TODO list.  Currently, it focuses on items
relevant to our upcoming release.


	Required before the next release.

Update to latest OpenVZ "rhel5" kernel.  If required, add fixes for the
most relevant and most critical recently-discovered vulnerabilities not
fixed in OpenVZ's kernel yet.  ("New" vulnerabilities in 2.6.x kernels
are discovered so often that there will almost always be some that are
already-public but not yet fixed in Red Hat's and OpenVZ's latest
released kernels yet, because of their QA delay.  A reasonable approach
may be to identify and fix the most relevant and most critical of those
vulnerabilities ourselves.  Luckily, most are not relevant and/or not
critical, but a few might be.  We'll see what the situation will be
shortly before our release.)

Bring the documentation translations in sync with English (or drop from
the release).  For example, translations of ARCHITECTURES are currently
outdated as it relates to i386 vs. i686.

Documentation updates for the release (e.g., the mentions of Owl-current
should probably be changed to mention the release instead).


	Desirable before the next release.

Start to implement security hardening of OpenVZ kernels.

Replace our hybrid 2.4+2.6 modutils with plain module-init-tools.

Update whatever packages we manage to, but don't break RHEL 4 compatibility
(we'll break it after the release).

User's Guide - review and edit the draft, identify and add important
missing chapters (adding/removing users, managing OpenVZ containers,
maybe something else).

SPARC, Alpha - builds, testing, fixes, final builds.  We haven't been
building Owl for these architectures for a while.  Possibly this is not
worth the time as it would delay the release.  Maybe it could be done
post-release, for the stable branch.

Consider/implement Perl Safe.pm bypass fixes (update the module?)
