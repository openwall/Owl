This is the public Owl to-do list.


	Owl 4.0 roadmap (lists only tasks that are not completed yet).

Support a package repository, possibly with Zypper, yum, or APT-RPM
(package one of these - and its prerequisites).

Toolchain and libraries updates:
gcc, OpenSSL - done (but will need minor updates before release);
glibc - in progress.

After or along with the toolchain and library updates, make other
package updates that we didn't dare to make shortly before 3.0 (OpenSSH,
etc.)  (If a certain outdated upstream version fails to build with the
new tools/libraries, just update it along with those tool/library
updates.  Otherwise, update it after the tool/library updates.)

Packages to consider and likely add (second batch, after toolchain and
libraries update): tcpdump (or tshark?), net2pcap, up to two
newbie-friendly text and hex editor(s) (consider: nano, le, dhex, beye),
wget (or put it in the repository only).

DHCP client with privsep.

PPP/PPPoE/PPTP support (add userland packages).

Full LAMP stack in base system (add Apache, PHP, MySQL or its fork).

Consider using a compressed filesystem to avoid requiring DVD media
or excluding source code.

UTF-8 support.  In Owl 3.0, we have building of UTF-8 locales disabled
in glibc.spec by default, and we have UTF-8 support disabled when
building other packages (e.g., Mutt).  This saves us from some security
issues that turn out to affect other distributions but not us, but
perhaps it's time to bite the bullet and support UTF-8 by default.

Move to OpenVZ's RHEL6 branch kernels.

IPv6 support (networking startup scripts, installer, default kernel
config).  Need to get the networking scripts replaced first (Simon?)

Replace LILO with Syslinux (ISOLINUX, EXTLINUX) - done for ISOs.

Add a GPT-aware disk partitioning tool (parted?), make it available
from the installer.


	Tasks left over from Owl 3.0 release preparations.

Bring the documentation translations in sync with English or drop them.
(French and German were in fact dropped from 3.0, but kept in -current
for now.  Maybe drop them from -current as well.)

Proceed to implement security hardening of OpenVZ kernels.

Replace our hybrid 2.4+2.6 modutils with plain module-init-tools.

User's Guide - review and edit the draft, make it public, then identify
and add important missing chapters (adding/removing users, managing
OpenVZ containers, maybe something else).
