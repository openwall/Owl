This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.

Security fixes have a "Severity" specified for the issue(s) being fixed.
The three comma-separated metrics given after "Severity:" are: risk
impact (low, medium, or high), attack vector (local, remote, or
indirect), and whether the attack may be carried out at will (active) or
not (passive).  Please note that the specified risk impact is just that,
it is not the overall severity, so other metrics are not factored into
it.  For example, a "high" impact "local, passive" issue is generally of
lower overall severity than a "high" impact "remote, active" one - this
is left up to our users to consider given their specific circumstances.

Per our current conventions, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability is
generally considered to have a "low" risk impact (even if it is a
"remote, active" one, which is to be considered separately as it may
make the vulnerability fairly critical under specific circumstances).
Some examples of "medium" impact vulnerabilities would be bugs enabling
non-critical information leaks, cryptographic signature forgeries,
and/or sending of or accepting spoofed/forged network traffic (where
such behavior was unexpected), as long as they would not directly allow
for a "high" impact attack.  Finally, a typical "high" impact
vulnerability would allow for privilege escalation such as ability to
execute code as another user ID than the attacker's (a "local" attack)
or without "legitimately" having such an ability (a "remote" attack).

The metrics specified are generally those for a worst case scenario,
however in certain cases ranges such as "none to low" or/and "local to
remote" may be specified, referring to the defaults vs. a worst case yet
"legitimate" custom configuration.  In some complicated cases, multiple
issues or attacks may be dealt with at once.  When those differ in their
severity metrics, we use slashes to denote the possible combinations.
For example, "low/none to high, remote/local" means that we've dealt
with issue(s) or attack(s) that are "low, remote" and those that are
"none to high, local".  In those tricky cases, we generally try to
clarify the specific issue(s) and their severities in the description.


	Changes made between Owl 3.0 and Owl-current.

2011/11/27	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low to medium, local/remote, active
Updated to 274.7.1.el5.028stab095.1.  It contains fixes for multiple
local and remote DoS via write into last block of ext4 file, mremap
syscall, receiving specially crafted packet when GRO is enabled,
receiving specially crafted packet on bridge devices, and via
clock_gettime syscall.  It also improves the randomness of IPv4 sequence
numbers via using MD5.  Owl is not affected to the rest of vulnerabilities
as we don't build the affected components (IPv6, ecryptfs, taskstats,
Xen, be2net driver, auerswald usb, TPM, CIFS).  Also there is an OpenVZ fix
of loosing socket permissions in /dev with udev+tmpfs during CT restore
(live migration).  Moved CONFIG_PCNET32 to =y again as VMware emulates NIC
of this type by default.

2011/10/29	Packages: syslinux, owl-cdrom; Owl/build/*
Packaged SYSLINUX - a collection of boot loaders - and moved from LILO
to ISOLINUX for the ISO-9660 images generated by "make iso".

2011/10/29	Package: gcc
Updated to 4.6.2.

2011/10/26	Package: tzdata
Updated to 2011m.

2011/10/26	Package: owl-startup
Added VLAN support (patch by Piotr Meyer).

2011/10/24	Package: pam
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
Applied upstream fixes for two vulnerabilities in pam_env.  This module
is not in use on default installs of Owl, and it never was, hence there
was no impact for default installs.

2011/10/24	Packages: gcc, gmp, libmpc, mpfr
Updated GCC to 4.6.1.  Packaged GMP, MPC, and MPFR - arbitrary precision
arithmetic libraries, which are required by the new GCC version.

2011/10/15	Package: tzdata
Updated to 2011l.  Reduced installed package size via use of hardlinks.

2011/10/15	Package: hardlink
New package: a program to consolidate duplicate files via hardlinks.

2011/10/10	Package: rpm
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, indirect, passive
Applied a fix for crash and potential arbitrary code execution when
processing a malformed/malicious package file.  Although an RPM package
can, by design, execute arbitrary code when installed or even during
installation, this issue would potentially allow a specially-crafted RPM
package to execute arbitrary code when the package metadata is merely
queried, including for digital signature verification.  Note that for
Owl RPM packages we do not rely on RPM's support for signatures;
instead, we sign *.mtree files.  Please continue to verify detached
GnuPG signatures that we provide for such files with gpg(1), and then
verify RPM package files against the message digests found in *.mtree
files with mtree(8) (both of these tools are part of Owl).  This kind of
verification was unaffected by this RPM issue.  Please note that use of
RPM on untrusted package files, even if just to verify a signature,
remains risky despite of this recent fix: RPM package format and
processing are complicated, so further issues of this kind are likely.

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3378

2011/10/10	Package: SysVinit
Applied a patch to set the shell name to /bin/bash, not /bin/sh, such
that colored ls output is enabled on our LiveCD.

2011/10/09	Packages: kernel, vzctl
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local, active
Updated the kernel to 2.6.18-274.3.1.el5.028stab094.3 (OpenVZ's latest
stable from their RHEL 5 based branch, now rebased on RHEL 5.7's).
Restricted permissions on /proc/slabinfo as a security hardening
measure.  Moved some OpenVZ features to modules like it is done in
OpenVZ's official kernel builds.  Changed CONFIG_UDF_FS=y to =m.
Changed CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP and most CONFIG_CRYPTO_* from =y to
=m.  On x86_64, changed CONFIG_PCNET32 and CONFIG_FORCEDETH (these are
some of the 100 Mbps NIC drivers) from =y to =m.  Of the 100 Mbps NIC
drivers, we're leaving only those for Intel, Realtek, and
NE2000-compatible PCI NICs built into the kernel on x86_64 now.  Set
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC94XX=y and CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA=y (the latter was
already =y on i686, now it is =y on x86_64 as well).  Although we
reference two Red Hat security advisories below, none of the worse than
local DoS issues listed in those advisories affect our previous kernel
builds, either because we do not build the affected components, or in
case of CVE-2011-2495 because we already had the permissions on
/proc/PID/io restricted before Owl 3.0 release.

2011/10/09	Packages: tzdata, glibc; Owl/build/installorder.conf
Moved timezone data files from glibc to new package tzdata, updated it
to version 2011k.

2011/09/07	Owl/build/{install*.sh,installorder.conf}
Support for optional package tags has been added to installorder.conf
and made use of in install*.sh scripts.  Currently supported are:
"D:" - CD only;
"d:" - exclude from CD;
"E:" - exclude from CD and OpenVZ container templates;
"H:" - host only (exclude from OpenVZ container templates).

2011/09/07	Package: owl-etc
Added /etc/owl-release (with "Owl-current post-3.0" in it).

2011/09/07	Package: owl-dev
Create /dev/sd* devices for 16 disks, not just 8 like we did before.

2011/07/27	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, active
Updated to 2.6.18-238.19.1.el5.028stab092.2.  Enabled CONFIG_BONDING=m
in both i686 and x86_64 kernels, enabled CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA=m in the
x86_64 kernel (i686 already had it at "=y").  Applied a patch adding
limited support for LSISAS8208ELP (PCI device id 0x0059), which provides
access to individual hard drives.  Moved the RLIMIT_NPROC check from
set_user() to execve(2) and adjusted set_user() so that it can't fail.
These changes were desirable to address missing setuid(2) return value
check vulnerabilities in user-space programs.

2011/07/25	Package: rpm
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, local, passive
Added a patch to remove unsafe file permissions (chmod'ing files to 0) on
package removal or upgrade to prevent continued access to such files via
hard-links possibly created by a user.

2011/06/21 -
2011/07/17	Packages: glibc, pam, shadow-utils, tcb
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, remote, active
crypt_blowfish has been updated to version 1.1 (and then to 1.2), which
fixes the 8-bit character handling bug and adds 8-bit test vectors and a
quick self-test on every password hash computation.  The impact of this
bug was that most (but not all) passwords containing non-ASCII
characters with the 8th bit set were hashed incorrectly, resulting in
password hashes incompatible with those of OpenBSD's original
implementation of bcrypt.  What's worse, in some cases (but not in all)
one, two, or three characters immediately preceding the 8-bit characters
were ignored by the password hash computation.  Thus, many passwords
containing characters with the 8th bit set were significantly easier to
crack than it was previously expected.  This primarily applies to
offline attacks against the password hashes (if the hashes are leaked or
stolen), but in rare extreme cases it might also apply to remote
password guessing attacks.  In practice, passwords with non-ASCII
characters are relatively uncommon and are typically more complicated
than average, so they're unlikely to be an attractive target for
attacks, despite of the weakness that this bug exposes them to.  Yet the
risk is there.  With this glibc update, existing users' passwords
containing characters with the 8th bit set will mostly stop working,
because the hashes will be computed correctly and not match the
incorrectly computed hashes recorded in the system.  In order to allow
users to log in after the upgrade even if they have a potentially
affected password, the newly introduced backwards compatibility hash
encoding prefix of "$2x$" may be used.  Such password hashes should only
be used during a transition period; when passwords are changed and
hashed using the correct algorithm, another newly introduced "$2y$"
prefix is used.  After installation of this glibc update, login services
such as sshd(8) should be restarted ("service sshd restart" and so on)
in order for users' newly changed passwords (with the "$2y$" prefix on
the hash encodings) to be recognized.

2011/06/22	Package: john
In an effort sponsored by Rapid7, the bitslice DES S-box expressions
have been replaced with those generated by Roman Rusakov specifically
for John the Ripper.  The corresponding assembly code for x86 with MMX,
SSE2, and for x86-64 with SSE2 has been re-generated.  Support for
bcrypt hashes of passwords containing characters with the 8th bit set
has been corrected.  (The old buggy behavior may be enabled per-hash,
using the "$2x$" prefix.)  The external mode virtual machine's
performance has been improved.  This update of John the Ripper has also
been released separately from Owl as version 1.7.8.

2011/06/09	Package: lilo
Updated to 23.2.

2011/05/03	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, local, active
Updated to 2.6.18-238.9.1.el5.028stab089.1.  This fixes obscure security
issues: kernel panic by unprivileged user via NFSv4 (CVE-2011-1090) and
NULL pointer dereference in GRO code (CVE-2011-1478).  It fixes
non-security issues with page tables accounting, AMD Bulldozer boot
process, OOM killer, and CPU stats bugs.  It also introduces numerous
features.

2011/04/02	Package: kernel
Updated to 2.6.18-238.5.1.el5.028stab085.3, which is now marked as
"RHEL5 stable".  This fixes a kernel Oops caused by nfsd.  Also fixed
an Owl-specific x86_64 gettimeofday(2) VDSO issue, which manifested
itself in some 64-bit programs inside containers with some Linux
distributions (not Owl) crashing with SIGSEGV.  The issue was new with
-238 kernels (thus, it was not present in Owl 3.0, nor in 3.0-stable).

2011/03/21	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, active
Backported fixes for information leaks in Netfilter modules: arp_tables
(CVE-2011-1170), ip_tables (CVE-2011-1171), ip6_tables (CVE-2011-1172),
and ipt_CLUSTERIP.  One must have CAP_NET_ADMIN to exploit these issues
(e.g. in-container root may trigger the leak).  The default Owl
installation is vulnerable to the infoleak in ip_tables only as we don't
ship other Netfilter modules nor have IPv6 enabled.

Updated to 4.6.

2011/03/14	Package: iptables
Changed the default for IPTABLES_STATUS_ARGS to "-nv".  Most
importantly, this disables the (risky and slow) reverse DNS lookups with
"service iptables status".

2011/03/12	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local/remote, active
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "RHEL5 testing" branch
(238.5.1.el5.028stab085.2) fixing a rare kernel panic with sysfs
virtualization, a potential livelock in dirty pages balancing, and a bug
in CFQ.  The new RHEL5 kernel revision that this OpenVZ kernel is based
on fixes a flaw in the garbage collector for AF_UNIX sockets
(CVE-2010-4249, local DoS) and a flaw in handling of received packets
exceeding the buffer limit (CVE-2010-4251, remote DoS).  (It also
includes a fix for CVE-2010-4655, but it was already included in our
2011/01/28 update.)  Fixed an Owl-current specific bug in checksum
calculation of fragmented ICMP echo request datagrams (reported by Piotr
Meyer).  Disabled the eepro100 driver in favor of e100.

2011/03/02	Package: vsftpd
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, remote, active
Updated to 2.3.4.  This release corrects a DoS vulnerability discovered by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz where an attacker permitted to login to an FTP server
would be able to cause the vsftpd child process(es) spawned for their
session(s) to consume excessive amounts of CPU time.  If the attack is carried
out on a sufficient number of FTP sessions (possibly from multiple source IP
addresses to exceed a possible per-source limit), the FTP service would become
unavailable and other services of the system would be greatly impacted.

SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, active
Updated to OpenVZ's 2.6.18-238.1.1.el5.028stab083.1.  Fixed a potential
information leak in net/core/ethtool.c: ethtool_get_regs() - this was
the portion of CVE-2010-4655 relevant to RHEL5 kernels.  According to
our analysis, this issue did not affect installs with default OpenVZ
container settings, but it could affect systems where a network device
was passed into an OpenVZ container by an administrator.  Made numerous
kernel configuration changes (enabled extra drivers, moved some to

(in Owl 3.0) with our own backports from a "testing" Red Hat kernel.)
