This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.

Security fixes have a "Severity" specified for the issue(s) being fixed.
The three comma-separated metrics given after "Severity:" are: risk
impact (low, medium, or high), attack vector (local, remote, or
indirect), and whether the attack may be carried out at will (active) or
not (passive).  Please note that the specified risk impact is just that,
it is not the overall severity, so other metrics are not factored into
it.  For example, a "high" impact "local, passive" issue is generally of
lower overall severity than a "high" impact "remote, active" one - this
is left up to our users to consider given their specific circumstances.

Per our current conventions, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability is
generally considered to have a "low" risk impact (even if it is a
"remote, active" one, which is to be considered separately as it may
make the vulnerability fairly critical under specific circumstances).
Some examples of "medium" impact vulnerabilities would be bugs enabling
non-critical information leaks, cryptographic signature forgeries,
and/or sending of or accepting spoofed/forged network traffic (where
such behavior was unexpected), as long as they would not directly allow
for a "high" impact attack.  Finally, a typical "high" impact
vulnerability would allow for privilege escalation such as ability to
execute code as another user ID than the attacker's (a "local" attack)
or without "legitimately" having such an ability (a "remote" attack).

The metrics specified are generally those for a worst case scenario,
however in certain cases ranges such as "none to low" or/and "local to
remote" may be specified, referring to the defaults vs. a worst case yet
"legitimate" custom configuration.  In some complicated cases, multiple
issues or attacks may be dealt with at once.  When those differ in their
severity metrics, we use slashes to denote the possible combinations.
For example, "low/none to high, remote/local" means that we've dealt
with issue(s) or attack(s) that are "low, remote" and those that are
"none to high, local".  In those tricky cases, we generally try to
clarify the specific issue(s) and their severities in the description.


	Changes made between Owl 3.0 and Owl-current.

2011/06/21	Package: glibc
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, remote, active
crypt_blowfish has been updated to version 1.1, which fixes the 8-bit
character handling bug and adds 8-bit test vectors and a quick self-test
on every password hash computation.  The impact of this bug was that
most (but not all) passwords containing non-ASCII characters with the
8th bit set were hashed incorrectly, resulting in password hashes
incompatible with those of OpenBSD's original implementation of bcrypt.
What's worse, in some cases (but not in all) one, two, or three
characters immediately preceding the 8-bit characters were ignored by
the password hash computation.  Thus, many passwords containing
characters with the 8th bit set are significantly easier to crack than
it was previously expected.  This primarily applies to offline attacks
against the password hashes (if they're leaked or stolen), but in rare
extreme cases it might also apply to remote password guessing attacks.
In practice, passwords with non-ASCII characters are relatively uncommon
and are typically more complicated than average, so they're unlikely to
be an attractive target for attacks, despite of the weakness that this
bug exposes them to.  Yet the risk is there.  With this glibc update,
existing users' passwords containing characters with the 8th bit set
will mostly stop working, because the hashes will be computed correctly
and not match the incorrectly computed hashes recorded in the system.
Please note that this does not always prevent potential exploitation of
the weakness described above; in some cases, alternate passwords may be
found that would produce those same hashes under the correct algorithm.
Thus, it is recommended that any passwords containing characters with
the 8th bit set be changed after this upgrade.  In order to allow users
to log in after the upgrade even if they have a potentially affected
password, the newly introduced backwards compatibility hash encoding
prefix of "$2x$" may be used (in place of the usual "$2a$").  Such
password hashes should only be used during a transition period; when
passwords are changed, the usual "$2a$" prefix is used, denoting the
correct algorithm.

2011/06/09	Package: lilo
Updated to 23.2.

2011/05/03	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, local, active
Updated to 2.6.18-238.9.1.el5.028stab089.1.  This fixes obscure security
issues: kernel panic by unprivileged user via NFSv4 (CVE-2011-1090) and
NULL pointer dereference in GRO code (CVE-2011-1478).  It fixes
non-security issues with page tables accounting, AMD Bulldozer boot
process, OOM killer, and CPU stats bugs.  It also introduces numerous
features.

2011/05/03	Package: iputils
Updated to s20101006.

2011/04/27	Package: john
Made numerous enhancements to John the Ripper, resulting in its 1.7.7
release, which is also part of Owl (as usual).

2011/04/02	Package: kernel
Updated to 2.6.18-238.5.1.el5.028stab085.3, which is now marked as
"RHEL5 stable".  This fixes a kernel Oops caused by nfsd.  Also fixed
an Owl-specific x86_64 gettimeofday(2) VDSO issue, which manifested
itself in some 64-bit programs inside containers with some Linux
distributions (not Owl) crashing with SIGSEGV.  The issue was new with
-238 kernels (thus, it was not present in Owl 3.0, nor in 3.0-stable).

2011/03/21	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, active
Backported fixes for information leaks in Netfilter modules: arp_tables
(CVE-2011-1170), ip_tables (CVE-2011-1171), ip6_tables (CVE-2011-1172),
and ipt_CLUSTERIP.  One must have CAP_NET_ADMIN to exploit these issues
(e.g. in-container root may trigger the leak).  The default Owl
installation is vulnerable to the infoleak in ip_tables only as we don't
ship other Netfilter modules nor have IPv6 enabled.

2011/03/17	Package: nmap
Updated to 5.51.

2011/03/15	Package: strace
Updated to 4.6.

2011/03/14	Package: iptables
Changed the default for IPTABLES_STATUS_ARGS to "-nv".  Most
importantly, this disables the (risky and slow) reverse DNS lookups with
"service iptables status".

2011/03/12	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, local/remote, active
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "RHEL5 testing" branch
(238.5.1.el5.028stab085.2) fixing a rare kernel panic with sysfs
virtualization, a potential livelock in dirty pages balancing, and a bug
in CFQ.  The new RHEL5 kernel revision that this OpenVZ kernel is based
on fixes a flaw in the garbage collector for AF_UNIX sockets
(CVE-2010-4249, local DoS) and a flaw in handling of received packets
exceeding the buffer limit (CVE-2010-4251, remote DoS).  (It also
includes a fix for CVE-2010-4655, but it was already included in our
2011/01/28 update.)  Fixed an Owl-current specific bug in checksum
calculation of fragmented ICMP echo request datagrams (reported by Piotr
Meyer).  Disabled the eepro100 driver in favor of e100.

2011/03/02	Package: vsftpd
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to low, remote, active
Updated to 2.3.4.  This release corrects a DoS vulnerability discovered by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz where an attacker permitted to login to an FTP server
would be able to cause the vsftpd child process(es) spawned for their
session(s) to consume excessive amounts of CPU time.  If the attack is carried
out on a sufficient number of FTP sessions (possibly from multiple source IP
addresses to exceed a possible per-source limit), the FTP service would become
unavailable and other services of the system would be greatly impacted.

2011/02/24	Packages: openssl, openssh
Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0d.

2011/02/18	Package: patchutils
Updated to 0.3.2.

2011/02/10	Package: kernel
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "RHEL5 testing" branch
(238.1.1.el5.028stab084.3), which includes updated fix for the x86_64
VDSO bug (the fix in 028stab084.1 was incomplete) and fix for optimized
kmem accounting bug.  Enabled Ethernet bridge support, PPP_MPPE, and ULOG
netfilter target.  For more info, see the changelog for the kernel
package.

2011/02/09	Package: patch
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, indirect, passive
Backported a fix for CVE-2010-4651.  The patch utility allowed ".." in
pathnames, and it also allowed absolute pathnames, either of which could
allow an attacker to create or modify arbitrary files outside of the
intended directory tree using a specially-crafted patch file.  Our
partial fix of 2011/02/02 did not address the absolute pathname case.

New package: libusb-compat is a compatibility layer allowing
applications written for libusb-0.1 to work with libusb-1.0.  It is
needed for usb_modeswitch.

2011/02/05	Package: kernel
Updated to upstream's "fixed fix for paging accounting".  The incomplete
fix introduced with our 2011/02/04 update could have caused trouble with
32-bit x86 kernels.
Reference:

2011/02/05	Package: shadow-utils
Added USERNAME_RELAXED and GROUPNAME_RELAXED options to /etc/login.defs,
which, if changed to "yes", will allow capital letters to be used in new
usernames and/or group names, respectively.

2011/02/04	Package: kernel
Updated the kernel to OpenVZ's latest from their "RHEL5 testing" branch
(238.1.1.el5.028stab084.1), which includes updated atl1 driver (Attansic
L1 Gigabit Ethernet).  Enabled VDSO on x86_64 (the actual bug was
believed to be fixed in 028stab084.1).  Applied upstream's initial "fix
for non-4levels page tables acct" (the bug was introduced in 084.1, so
we did not have it before).

2011/02/02	Package: patch
Backported a partial fix for CVE-2010-4651.  Since the fix turned out to
be incomplete, this change is not actually fixing CVE-2010-4651 yet.

2011/01/31 -
2011/02/01	Packages: kernel, iputils, owl-etc, owl-startup
Added support for non-raw ICMP sockets to the kernel and made use of
said support in ping(1).

2011/01/30	Package: vconfig
New package: vconfig is a user mode program to add and remove 802.1q
VLAN virtual devices from Ethernet devices.

2011/01/29	Package: kernel
Dealt with two known critical x86_64 specific bugs introduced in
2.6.18-238.1.1.el5.028stab083.1, applying a fix for one of them (bootup
on systems with more than 8 logical CPUs) and working around the other
(VDSO, which is now temporarily disabled on x86_64, to be re-enabled
with the next kernel update).
Reference:

2011/01/28	Package: usbutils
New package: usbutils contains the lsusb utility for inspecting the
devices connected to the USB bus.

2011/01/28	Package: libusb1
New package: libusb is a library providing access to USB devices.

2011/01/28	Package: kernel
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, active
Updated to OpenVZ's 2.6.18-238.1.1.el5.028stab083.1.  Fixed a potential
information leak in net/core/ethtool.c: ethtool_get_regs() - this was
the portion of CVE-2010-4655 relevant to RHEL5 kernels.  According to
our analysis, this issue did not affect installs with default OpenVZ
container settings, but it could affect systems where a network device
was passed into an OpenVZ container by an administrator.  Made numerous
kernel configuration changes (enabled extra drivers, moved some to
modules), documented the changes (and the rationale behind them) in the
change log for the kernel package.  (The important and relevant ones of
the security fixes described in the Red Hat security advisories
referenced below were already included in our previous kernel revision
(in Owl 3.0) with our own backports from a "testing" Red Hat kernel.)
