This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.

Security fixes have a "Severity" specified for the issue(s) being fixed.
The three comma-separated metrics given after "Severity:" are: risk
impact (low, medium, or high), attack vector (local, remote, or
indirect), and whether the attack may be carried out at will (active) or
not (passive).  Please note that the specified risk impact is just that,
it is not the overall severity, so other metrics are not factored into
it.  For example, a "high" impact "local, passive" issue is generally of
lower overall severity than a "high" impact "remote, active" one - this
is left up to our users to consider given their specific circumstances.

Per our current conventions, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability is
generally considered to have a "low" risk impact (even if it is a
"remote, active" one, which is to be considered separately as it may
make the vulnerability fairly critical under specific circumstances).
Some examples of "medium" impact vulnerabilities would be bugs enabling
non-critical information leaks, cryptographic signature forgeries,
and/or sending of or accepting spoofed/forged network traffic (where
such behavior was unexpected), as long as they would not directly allow
for a "high" impact attack.  Finally, a typical "high" impact
vulnerability would allow for privilege escalation such as ability to
execute code as another user ID than the attacker's (a "local" attack)
or without "legitimately" having such an ability (a "remote" attack).

The metrics specified are generally those for a worst case scenario,
however in certain cases ranges such as "none to low" or/and "local to
remote" may be specified, referring to the defaults vs. a worst case yet
"legitimate" custom configuration.  In some complicated cases, multiple
issues or attacks may be dealt with at once.  When those differ in their
severity metrics, we use slashes to denote the possible combinations.
For example, "low/none to high, remote/local" means that we've dealt
with issue(s) or attack(s) that are "low, remote" and those that are
"none to high, local".  In those tricky cases, we generally try to
clarify the specific issue(s) and their severities in the description.


	Changes made between Owl 3.0 and Owl-current.

2011/01/24	Package: owl-startup
Added "-s 131072" to the dmesg invocation in rc.sysinit.  Without this
change, /var/run/dmesg.boot was often incomplete.

2011/01/24	Package: lilo
Updated to 23.1.

2011/01/24	Package: vim
Moved a few syntax highlighting related files from the vim-syntax to the
vim-enhanced subpackage to correct a packaging error where some files
in vim-enhanced were dependent upon files from vim-syntax, which is not
installed by default.
