This file explains some of the conventions to follow for those wishing
to contribute to the project.


	Patch file naming.

Use the following syntax for patch file names:

	NAME-VERSION-ORIGIN-WHAT.diff

where NAME and VERSION are the package name and version, ORIGIN is an
abbreviation of the distribution name(s) the patch originates from,
and WHAT is a description of what the patch is for or what it does.

If a single patch file is based on pieces from more than one
distribution, all are to be included in ORIGIN in order of relevance.
For patches developed as a part of Owl, ORIGIN is to be set to "owl".
If a patch is derived from another distribution but with significant
changes applied, ORIGIN should include "-owl-" as well (which would
indicate that any bugs are ours).  If a patch has been extracted from
the primary CVS repository for the package in question (for example,
this may be the case for various back-ports), ORIGIN should be set to
"cvs" and WHAT to the date it corresponds to (as YYYYMMDD) plus the
usual description of the patch.

There're also some common WHAT's to use whenever applicable:

fixes	- cumulative bug, reliability, and/or security patches
linux	- changes needed to build on Linux (for ported software)
man	- man page patches only
tmp	- patches dealing with temporary file handling issues

This is NOT to suggest you should try to arrange your modifications
such that the patch files fit one of these categories.  In fact, it is
often preferable to do things differently.  This is just to say that
if you happen to have a patch file that matches one of the categories,
name it accordingly (such as, "-tmp-" and not, say, "-mkstemp-").
