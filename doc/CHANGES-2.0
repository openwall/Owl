This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 1.1 and Owl-current.

2004/01/21 -
2004/01/28	Packages: links, elinks
Links has been replaced with ELinks 0.9.0 and further with 0.9.1.

2004/01/20 -
2004/01/25	Package: perl
Updated to 5.8.3.

2004/01/18	Package: owl-startup
Added /sbin/service script for Red Hat Linux compatibility.  Set
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0 to prevent leaks of the exact system's
uptime.  There's a detailed comment in /etc/sysctl.conf explaining
this option and possible drawbacks of having it set one way or the
other.

2004/01/17	Package: procps
In top, handle ticks going backwards gracefully.  This may happen due
to kernel and hardware issues and previously resulted in top reporting
absurd idle processor time percentages under high load on SMP systems.

2004/01/14	Package: screen
Updated to 4.0.2.

2004/01/10	Package: john
Corrected a segfault with --stdin introduced with John 1.6.34.2.

2004/01/05	Package: sysklogd
The startup script will now accept command-line options for syslogd
and klogd specified in /etc/sysconfig/syslog.
