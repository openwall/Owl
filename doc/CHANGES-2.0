This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 1.1 and Owl-current.

2004/03/18	Package: openssl
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, passive to active
Updated to 0.9.6m.  This release of OpenSSL fixes a NULL pointer
dereference during SSL handshake.  If triggered, the bug would cause
the remote process or thread to crash.  Depending on the application
this could lead to a denial of service.  For the applications which
are a part of Owl, it's only individual invocations of network clients
which are affected and may be caused to crash by a malicious server.

2004/02/24	Packages: readline, bash, bc, gdb, lftp

2004/02/18	Package: libnids
Added a patch to support Prism wireless cards, by Snax of AirSnort
project (http://airsnort.shmoo.com).

2004/02/15	Package: libpcap
Updated to 0.8.1

2004/02/13	Package: mutt
Updated to 1.4.2.1.  This release of Mutt is a security fix, but Owl
was not affected with its current glibc because of the lack of UTF-8
locales support.

2004/02/08	Package: SimplePAMApps
In login(1) and su(1), generate ut_id's consistently with libutempter
and OpenSSH (patch from Dmitry V. Levin of ALT Linux).  This will make
"su -" replace existing utmp entries for the duration of the su session.

2004/02/08	Package: chkconfig
Updated to 1.3.9.

2004/01/20 -
2004/01/29	Packages: perl, vim
Updated Perl to 5.8.3.

2004/01/28	Packages: links, elinks
Links has been replaced with ELinks 0.9.0 and further with 0.9.1.

2004/01/18	Package: owl-startup
Added /sbin/service script for Red Hat Linux compatibility.  Set
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0 to prevent leaks of the exact system's
uptime.  There's a detailed comment in /etc/sysctl.conf explaining
this option and possible drawbacks of having it set one way or the
other.

2004/01/17	Package: procps
In top, handle ticks going backwards gracefully.  This may happen due
to kernel and hardware issues and previously resulted in top reporting
absurd idle processor time percentages under high load on SMP systems.

2004/01/14	Package: screen
Updated to 4.0.2.

2004/01/10	Package: john
Corrected a segfault with --stdin introduced with John 1.6.34.2.

2004/01/05	Package: sysklogd
The startup script will now accept command-line options for syslogd
and klogd specified in /etc/sysconfig/syslog.
