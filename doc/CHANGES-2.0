This file lists the major changes made between the last released
version of Owl and Owl-current.  While some of the changes listed here
may also be made to a stable branch, the complete lists of stable
branch changes are included with those branches and as errata for the
corresponding Owl releases only.

This is very far from an exhaustive list of changes.  Small changes to
individual packages won't be mentioned here unless they fix a security
or a critical reliability problem.  They are, however, mentioned in
change logs for the packages themselves.


	Changes made between Owl 1.1 and Owl-current.

2004/06/02	Package: scanlogd
chroot to /var/empty to further reduce the impact of potential bugs in
scanlogd and the libraries that it uses.

2004/05/19	Packages: tcp_wrappers, openssh, xinetd
Added a patch to tcp_wrappers to also build a shared version of the
libwrap library.

2004/05/18	Package: cvs
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to high, remote, active
Added a back-port of the fix for the CVS server heap-based buffer
overflow vulnerability in processing of malformed "Entry" lines in
combination with "Is-modified" and "Unchanged" discovered by Stefan
Esser.  The vulnerability is known to be exploitable allowing for a
malicious client to execute arbitrary code within the CVS server.
Despite this fix, it should not be assumed that CVS server provides
any security against a malicious client.  If required, any
restrictions on the actions CVS server is allowed to perform should be
imposed at the OS level.

2004/05/14	Packages: ncurses, procps
Updated ncurses to 5.4 with official patches up to 20040508.

2004/05/07	Package: binutils
Updated to 2.15.90.0.3.

2004/04/18	kernel; Package: owl-cdrom
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, local, active
Updated to Linux 2.4.26-ow1.  Linux 2.4.26 (and thus 2.4.26-ow1) fixes
an integer overflow vulnerability in processing of the MCAST_MSFILTER
socket option discovered by Paul Starzetz.  When properly exploited,
the bug would lead to a local root compromise.  Also included in this
kernel release is a fix for the ext3/XFS information leak discovered
by Solar Designer and a number of other relatively minor fixes.  As it
relates to Owl, the kernel image on Owl CDs will now include the
Broadcom Tigon3 Gigabit Ethernet driver and the BusLogic SCSI
controller driver, but will not include support for IrDA (had to drop
it to make room for the extra device drivers).

2004/04/14	Package: cvs
SECURITY FIX	Severity: high, remote, passive
Added a fix to the CVS client to ensure that pathnames provided by a
CVS server point to within the working directory.  Without this fix, a
malicious CVS server could cause the CVS client to attempt to create
files at arbitrary locations thus gaining control over the user
account.  This problem has been brought to the attention of CVS
developers and distribution vendors by Sebastian Krahmer of SuSE.
Additionally, CVS server has been further restricted to disallow the
use of relative pathnames to view files outside of the CVS repository.
However, despite this last fix, it should not be assumed that CVS
server provides any security against a malicious client being able to
access arbitrary files available under the privileges granted to the
CVS server at the OS level.

2004/03/18	Package: openssl
SECURITY FIX	Severity: low, remote, passive to active
Updated to 0.9.6m.  This release of OpenSSL fixes a NULL pointer
dereference during SSL handshake.  If triggered, the bug would cause
the remote process or thread to crash.  Depending on the application
this could lead to a denial of service.  For the applications which
are a part of Owl, it's only individual invocations of network clients
which are affected and may be caused to crash by a malicious server.

2004/02/20 -
2004/02/24	Packages: readline, bash, bc, gdb, lftp
Updated readline to 4.3.

2004/02/18	Package: libnids
Added a patch to support Prism wireless cards, by Snax of AirSnort
project (http://airsnort.shmoo.com).

2004/02/15	Package: libpcap
Updated to 0.8.1

2004/02/13	Package: mutt
Updated to 1.4.2.1.  This release of Mutt is a security fix, but Owl
was not affected with its current glibc because of the lack of UTF-8
locales support.

2004/02/08	Package: SimplePAMApps
In login(1) and su(1), generate ut_id's consistently with libutempter
and OpenSSH (patch from Dmitry V. Levin of ALT Linux).  This will make
"su -" replace existing utmp entries for the duration of the su session.

2004/02/08	Package: chkconfig
Updated to 1.3.9.

2004/01/20 -
2004/01/29	Packages: perl, vim
Updated Perl to 5.8.3.

2004/01/21 -
2004/01/28	Packages: links, elinks
Links has been replaced with ELinks 0.9.0 and further with 0.9.1.

2004/01/18	Package: owl-startup
Added /sbin/service script for Red Hat Linux compatibility.  Set
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0 to prevent leaks of the exact system's
uptime.  There's a detailed comment in /etc/sysctl.conf explaining
this option and possible drawbacks of having it set one way or the
other.

2004/01/17	Package: procps
In top, handle ticks going backwards gracefully.  This may happen due
to kernel and hardware issues and previously resulted in top reporting
absurd idle processor time percentages under high load on SMP systems.

2004/01/14	Package: screen
Updated to 4.0.2.

2004/01/10	Package: john
Corrected a segfault with --stdin introduced with John 1.6.34.2.

2004/01/05	Package: sysklogd
The startup script will now accept command-line options for syslogd
and klogd specified in /etc/sysconfig/syslog.
