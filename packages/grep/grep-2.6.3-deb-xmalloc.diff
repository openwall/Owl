Subject: [PATCH] grep: make kwset's obstack use xmalloc, not malloc

This insidious bug could make grep fail to diagnose a failed malloc,
and then proceed to dereference the resulting NULL pointer.
Note that this bug was unlikely ever to cause real trouble; without
the fix, grep would segfault upon OOM, now it exits with a diagnostic.
* src/kwset.c (malloc) [GREP]: Define without the "(s)" macro
parameter, so that unadorned uses of malloc are also mapped to xmalloc.
One such use is in the expansion of obstack_init.
