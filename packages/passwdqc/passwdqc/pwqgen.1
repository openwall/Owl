.Sh NAME
.Nm pwqgen
.Nd Generate quality controllable random passphrase
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program generates random passphrase using libpasswdqc library.
Strength of the generated passphrase depends on size of randomness
read from
.Pa /dev/urandom .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm random Ns = Ns Ar N
.Pq default: Cm random Ns = Ns 42
The size of randomly-generated passphrase in bits (24 to 72).
.It Cm config Ns = Ns Ar FILE
Load config
.Ar FILE
in
.Cm passwdqc.conf
format.  This file may define any options described in
.Xr passwdqc.conf 5 , but only
.Cm random
and
.Cm config
options are honored by
.Nm .
.It Cm --version
Output
.Nm
program version and exit.
.It Cm -h , --help
Output
.Nm
help text and exit.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUE
.Nm
exits with nonzero status when it encounters invalid config file,
invalid option, invalid parameter value, when it fails to obtain enough
randomness, and in any case when it fails to generate passphrase.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/passwdqc.conf .
