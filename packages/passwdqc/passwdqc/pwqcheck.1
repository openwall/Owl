.Sh NAME
.Nm pwqcheck
.Nd Check passphrase quality
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program checks passphrase quality using libpasswdqc library.
It expects to read 3 lines from standard input:
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact -offset indent
.It first line is a new password,
.It second line is an old password, and
.It third line is either an existing account name or a Xr passwd 5 entry.
.El
.Pp
There is a number of supported options which can be used to control the
.Nm
behavior.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm min Ns = Ns Ar N0 , Ns Ar N1 , Ns Ar N2 , Ns Ar N3 , Ns Ar N4
.Pq default: Cm min Ns = Ns Cm disabled , Ns 24 , Ns 11 , Ns 8 , Ns 7
The minimum allowed password lengths for different kinds of
passwords/passphrases.
The keyword
.Cm disabled
can be used to
disallow passwords of a given kind regardless of their length.
Each subsequent number is required to be no larger than the preceding
one.
.Pp
.Ar N0
is used for passwords consisting of characters from one character
class only.
The character classes are: digits, lower-case letters, upper-case
letters, and other characters.
There is also a special class for
.No non- Ns Tn ASCII
characters, which could not be classified, but are assumed to be non-digits.
.Pp
.Ar N1
is used for passwords consisting of characters from two character
classes that do not meet the requirements for a passphrase.
.Pp
.Ar N2
is used for passphrases.
Note that besides meeting this length requirement,
a passphrase must also consist of a sufficient number of words (see the
.Cm passphrase
option below).
.Pp
.Ar N3
and
.Ar N4
are used for passwords consisting of characters from three
and four character classes, respectively.
.Pp
When calculating the number of character classes, upper-case letters
used as the first character and digits used as the last character of a
password are not counted.
.Pp
In addition to being sufficiently long, passwords are required to
contain enough different characters for the character classes and
the minimum length they have been checked against.
.Pp
.It Cm max Ns = Ns Ar N
.Pq default: Cm max Ns = Ns 40
The maximum allowed password length.
This can be used to prevent users from setting passwords that may be
too long for some system services.
The value 8 is treated specially: if
.Cm max
is set to 8, passwords longer than 8 characters will not be rejected,
but will be truncated to 8 characters for the strength checks and the
user will be warned.
This is to be used with the traditional DES-based password hashes,
which truncate the password at 8 characters.
.Pp
It is important that you do set
.Cm max Ns = Ns 8
if you are using the traditional
hashes, or some weak passwords will pass the checks.
.It Cm passphrase Ns = Ns Ar N
.Pq default: Cm passphrase Ns = Ns 3
The number of words required for a passphrase.
.It Cm match Ns = Ns Ar N
.Pq default: Cm match Ns = Ns 4
The length of common substring required to conclude that a password is
at least partially based on information found in a character string,
or 0 to disable the substring search.
Note that the password will not be rejected once a weak substring is
found; it will instead be subjected to the usual strength requirements
with the weak substring removed.
.Pp
The substring search is case-insensitive and is able to detect and
remove a common substring spelled backwards.
.It Cm config Ns = Ns Ar FILE
Load config
.Ar FILE
in
.Cm passwdqc.conf
format.  This file may define any options described in
.Xr passwdqc.conf 5 , but only
.Cm min Ns , Cm max Ns , Cm passphrase Ns , Cm match
and
.Cm config
options are honored by
.Nm .
.It Cm --version
Output
.Nm
program version and exit.
.It Cm -h , --help
Output
.Nm
help text and exit.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUE
.Nm
exits with nonzero status when it encounters invalid config file,
invalid option, invalid parameter value, invalid data in standard input,
when it detects weak passphrase, and in any case when it fails to check
passphrase strength.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/passwdqc.conf .

Both the
.Nm
program, which was originally made for ALT GNU/*/Linux, and this manual page
.Pq derived from the pam_passwdqc author's documentation Ns ,
which was made for Openwall GNU/*/Linux, are written by
