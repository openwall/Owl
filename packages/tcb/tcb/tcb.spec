%description
The tcb package consists of three components: pam_tcb, libnss_tcb, and
libtcb.  pam_tcb is a PAM module which supersedes pam_unix and pam_pwdb.
It also implements the tcb password shadowing scheme (see tcb(5) for
details).  The tcb scheme allows many core system utilities (passwd(1)
being the primary example) to operate with little privilege.  libnss_tcb
is the accompanying NSS module.  libtcb contains code shared by the
PAM and NSS modules and is also used by programs from the shadow-utils
package.

%changelog
* Tue Aug 23 2005 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.9-owl1
- Restricted list of global symbols exported by the library,
NSS and PAM modules.
- In the PAM module, implemented "openlog" option and disabled
openlog/closelog calls for each logging function invocation,
according to new convention introduced in pam-0.80-owl1.
- Packaged pam_pwdb.so symlink in addition to pam_unix.so.
- Packaged %_libexecdir/chkpwd directory.

* Fri Apr 22 2005 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.9-owl1
- Deal with compilation warnings generated by new gcc compiler.

* Wed Jan 05 2005 (GalaxyMaster) <galaxy-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.8-owl2
- Tell RPM to not verify permissions and group ownership of tcb_chkpwd since
we're setting the correct permissions via a trigger on shadow-utils.
- Cleaned up the spec.

* Fri Jun 25 2004 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.8-owl1
- tcb_unconvert: Zero errno before each readdir(3) call.

* Sun Nov 02 2003 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.7-owl1
- Build the PAM module with -fPIC.
- Renamed FAKEROOT to DESTDIR.

* Wed Oct 29 2003 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.6-owl1
- Don't depend on *BSD-style asprintf(3) semantics as Ulrich has rejected
that patch.
- Require glibc-crypt_blowfish-devel for builds, but just glibc-crypt_blowfish
for package installation.

* Fri Apr 18 2003 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.5-owl1
- Use bold face for component names in .SH NAME, but avoid *roff commands
to not confuse makewhatis and apropos(1).

* Wed Apr 16 2003 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.4-owl1
- In pam_tcb, implemented proper fake salt creation to avoid a timing attack.

* Thu Oct 31 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Optimized unix_verify_password() a bit, from Dmitry V. Levin of ALT Linux.

* Wed Oct 30 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- In tcb_convert.8, noted that /etc/shadow backups need to be removed as
well, with /etc/shadow- as the particular example.

* Thu Oct 24 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Cleaned up the recent changes.

* Mon Aug 19 2002 Rafal Wojtczuk <nergal-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Merged enhancements which remove 32K users limit.
- Added ENABLE_SETFSUGID.
- Pass the username to the helper binary such that it can handle non-unique
UIDs.

* Mon Aug 19 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Moved libtcb.so symlink to /usr/lib (patch from Dmitry V. Levin).

* Sun Aug 04 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Moved the pam_tcb and pam_unix manual pages to section 8.

* Sun Jul 07 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>

precedence over expired accounts (sp_expire).

* Sun May 19 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Moved the chkpwd directory to /usr/libexec.

* Mon Feb 04 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Enforce our new spec file conventions.

* Sun Dec 09 2001 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Various minor fixes from Dmitry V. Levin of ALT Linux.
- A GNU-style ChangeLog will now be maintained.

* Sun Nov 18 2001 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Patches from Nergal to make delays on failure work with the "fork"
option and to not produce a warning when su'ing to pseudo-users from
root.

* Fri Nov 16 2001 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Don't include the /sbin/chkpwd.d directory in this package as it's
provided by our pam package.
- Use a trigger on shadow-utils for possibly creating and making use of
group shadow.  This makes no difference on Owl as either the group is
provided by owl-etc (on new installs) or groupadd is already available
when this package is installed, but may be useful on hybrid systems.

* Thu Nov 15 2001 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Provide compatibility symlinks and a man page for pam_unix.
- tcb_convert(8) man page fixes from Nergal.

more consistent with those used by pam_passwdqc.
- Improved logging.
