The tcb package contains core components of our "tcb" suite
implementing the alternative password shadowing scheme on Openwall
GNU/*/Linux (Owl).  It is being made available separately from Owl
primarily for use by other distributions.  For more information,
please refer to:

http://www.openwall.com/tcb/

You need to have the password hashing framework introduced with
crypt_blowfish patched into glibc to compile and use this.

crypt_blowfish is available at:
