pam_mktemp is a PAM module which may be used with a PAM-aware login
service to provide per-user private directories under /tmp as a part
of PAM session or account management.

When an interactive (shell) session is started, a directory is created
and the environment variables TMPDIR and TMP are set to the name of
the directory.
