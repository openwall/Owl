In addition or alternatively to the license above, the following
components are available to you under more relaxed terms:

As the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based password hashing)
implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed a derived version
of this implementation in the public domain.  This derived version may
be obtained at:

	http://www.openwall.com/crypt/

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).

Finally, I have placed the CRC-32 implementation (crc32.c, crc32.h) in
the public domain.


	Commercial licensing.

Commercial licenses (non-GPL) are available upon request.
