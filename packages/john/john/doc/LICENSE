	Relaxed terms for certain components.

In addition or alternatively to the license above, many components are
available to you under more relaxed terms (most commonly under cut-down
BSD license) as specified in the corresponding source files.

Furthermore, as the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based
password hashing) implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed
a derived version of this implementation in the public domain.  This
derived version may be obtained at:

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).
