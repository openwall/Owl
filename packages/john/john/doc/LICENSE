Optimized DES S-box expressions (nonstd.c, sboxes.c) have been produced

based on Bruce Ford and Rémi Guyomarch's implementation.

As the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based password hashing)
implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed a derived version
of this implementation into the public domain.  This derived version may

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).
