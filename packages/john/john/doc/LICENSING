John the Ripper 1.7, when released, is going to be GPL'ed.  However,
the licensing status of one source file -- x86-mmx.S -- is non-obvious
to me.  I have explicit permission to use the S-box code found in this
file in John, but I'm not sure whether this was meant to imply that I
am free to put this code under a license of my choice.  I haven't got
a reply regarding this so far.

Portions of this code I've placed into the public domain as a separate
package designed to provide modern password hashing for your software
and your servers (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).  The
package can be found at:
