share your experience with using John the Ripper and ask questions
(preferably advanced ones) on the list.  Be sure to specify an
informative message subject whenever you post to the list (that is,
something better than "question" or "problem").  If you need to provide
a binary file, place it on a private URL and post that, do not attach
the file to your message.

If you need to contact me privately, please e-mail me at the address
