/*
 * Notes to packagers of John for *BSD "ports", Linux distributions, etc.:
 *
 * You do need to set JOHN_SYSTEMWIDE to 1, but you do not need to patch this
 * file for that.  Instead, you can pass -DJOHN_SYSTEMWIDE=1 in CFLAGS.  You
 * also do not need to patch the Makefile for that since you can pass the
 * CFLAGS via "make" command line.  Similarly, you do not need to patch
 * anything to change JOHN_SYSTEMWIDE_EXEC and JOHN_SYSTEMWIDE_HOME (although
 * the defaults for these should be fine).
 *
 * JOHN_SYSTEMWIDE_EXEC should be set to the _directory_ where John will look
 * for its "CPU fallback" program binary (which should be another build of John
 * itself).  This is activated when John is compiled with -DCPU_FALLBACK=1.
 * The fallback program binary name is defined with CPU_FALLBACK_BINARY in
 * architecture-specific header files such as x86-64.h (and the default should
 * be fine - no need to patch it).  On x86-64, this may be used to
 * transparently fallback from a -64-xop build to -64-avx, then to plain -64
 * (which implies SSE2).  On 32-bit x86, this may be used to fallback from -xop
 * to -avx, then to -sse2, then to -mmx, and finally to -any.  Please do make
 * use of this functionality in your package if it is built for x86-64 or
 * 32-bit x86 (yes, you may need to make five builds of John for a single
 * 32-bit x86 binary package).
 *
 * Similarly, -DOMP_FALLBACK=1 activates fallback to OMP_FALLBACK_BINARY in the
 * JOHN_SYSTEMWIDE_EXEC directory when an OpenMP-enabled build of John
 * determines that it would otherwise run only one thread, which would often
 * be less optimal than running a non-OpenMP build.
 *
 * CPU_FALLBACK and OMP_FALLBACK may be used together, but in that case you
 * need to override some of the default fallback binary filenames such that you
 * can have both OpenMP-enabled and non-OpenMP fallback binaries that use the
 * same CPU instruction set extensions.  You can do these overrides with
 * options like -DOMP_FALLBACK_BINARY='"john-non-omp-non-avx"' (leaving
 * CPU_FALLBACK_BINARY at its default of "john-non-avx") or
 * -DOMP_FALLBACK_BINARY='"john-sse2"' and
 * -DCPU_FALLBACK_BINARY='"john-omp-sse2"' as fallbacks from an OpenMP-enabled
 * -avx build.  Please note that you do not need to patch any John files for
 * this, not even the Makefile.  For an example of passing these settings from
 * an RPM spec file, please refer to john.spec used in Owl.
 *
 * "$JOHN" is supposed to be expanded at runtime.  Please do not replace
 * it with a specific path, neither in this file nor in the default
 * john.conf, if at all possible.
