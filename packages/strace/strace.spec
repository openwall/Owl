%description
The strace program intercepts and records the system calls invoked by
a running process.  strace can print a record of each system call, its
arguments, and its return value.  strace is useful for diagnosing
problems and debugging, as well as for instructional purposes.

%description graph
The strace-graph Perl script processes strace -f output and displays a
graph of invoked subprocesses.  It is useful for finding out what complex
commands do.
