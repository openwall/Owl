.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents \fBhardlink\fP, a
program which consolidates duplicate files in one or more directories
using hardlinks.
.PP
\fBhardlink\fP traverses one
or more directories searching for duplicate files.  When it finds duplicate
files, it uses one of them as the master.  It then removes all other
duplicates and places a hardlink for each one pointing to the master file.
This allows for conservation of disk space where multiple directories
on a single filesystem contain many duplicate files.
.PP
Since hard links can only span a single filesystem, \fBhardlink\fP
is only useful when all directories specified are on the same filesystem.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.IP "\fB-c\fP" 10
Compare only the contents of the files being considered for consolidation.
Disregards permission, ownership and other differences.
.IP "\fB-n\fP" 10
Do not perform the consolidation; only print what would be changed.
.IP "\fB-v\fP" 10
Print summary after hardlinking.
.IP "\fB-vv\fP" 10
Print every hardlinked file and bytes saved. Also print summary after hardlinking.
.IP "\fB-h\fP" 10
Show help.

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBhardlink\fP assumes that its target directory trees do not change from under
it.  If a directory tree does change, this may result in \fBhardlink\fP
accessing files and/or directories outside of the intended directory tree.
Thus, you must avoid running \fBhardlink\fP on potentially changing directory
trees, and especially on directory trees under control of another user.
