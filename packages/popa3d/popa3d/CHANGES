	Changes made between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 (2012/08/15).

Handle possible NULL returns from crypt(3).

Revised the included MD5 routines to help the compiler detect a common
subexpression between steps in round 3.

Switched to heavily cut-down BSD license.


	Changes made between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 (2006/05/23).

A couple of optimizations specific to x86-64 have been applied to the
included MD5 routines.


	Changes made between 1.0 and 1.0.1 (2006/03/07).

Use sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) instead of CLK_TCK when _SC_CLK_TCK is known to
be available or CLK_TCK is not.  This is needed for portability to glibc
2.3.90+ and possibly to other recent and future systems.

Use socklen_t where appropriate.


	Changes made between 0.6.4.1 and 1.0 (2005/05/26).

Corrected the source code to not break C strict aliasing rules (this
only affected auth_pam.c).

With Sun PAM (Solaris, HP-UX), insist on only one PAM message per call
to the conversation function because of differences in the layout of
the "msg" parameter.

Bumped the default limits to values that are way too high for most
systems (I'm sure these will still be insufficient for some, though,
but hopefully those systems actually got experienced sysadmins).
Added comments suggesting that these defaults be decreased on
particular installs.


	Changes made between 0.6.4 and 0.6.4.1 (2004/07/22).

Bugfix: actually zeroize the context structure in MD5_Final().  Thanks
to Andrey Panin and Timo Sirainen for bringing this to my attention.
This change makes no difference for popa3d, but may be important for
possible other applications which might use these MD5 routines.


	Changes made between 0.6.3 and 0.6.4 (2003/11/17).

The uses of sprintf(3) have been replaced by the concat() function
implemented locally.


	Changes made between 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 (2003/04/13).

libpam_userpass support (with pam_userpass 0.9+).


	Changes made between 0.6.1 and 0.6.2 (2003/03/10).

Rate-limit the "sessions limit reached" log message similarly to the
per-source one; spotted by Michael Tokarev.

Started maintaining this change log (including information on a few
past versions), due to popular demand.  Added a separate file with
contact information (homepage, mailing list, author e-mail address,
commercial support).  Updated the installation instructions to note
the importance of authentication and locking method choice, added
instructions on the use of xinetd and popa3d's standalone mode.


	Changes made between 0.6 and 0.6.1 (2003/03/02).

Ensure proper logging of abnormally terminated sessions: distinguish
server failures from external modification to the mailbox by other
instances of popa3d or other MUAs.  Previously, if external mailbox
modification would occur during processing of a RETR command, popa3d
could improperly log a "server failure" (0.6) or even a "premature
disconnect" (older versions).

Added version.c and the -V option to print out version information.


	Changes made between 0.5.9 and 0.6 (2003/02/20).

Corrected the message size reporting bug introduced with 0.4.9.3 and
now reported on popa3d-users by Nuno Teixeira.  The only known POP3
client known to complain about this is fetchmail, and it would get the
mail correctly anyway.


	Changes made between 0.5.1 and 0.5.9 (2002/09/24).

Correctness and interoperability fixes.  This includes a workaround
for an Outlook Express client bug which would show up on body-less
messages.


	Changes made between 0.5 and 0.5.1 (2002/04/17).

Re-worked all of the UIDL calculation, adding support for multi-line
headers and re-considering which headers to use.

Let the local delivery agent help generate unique IDs by setting the
X-Delivery-ID: header.


	Changes made between 0.4 and 0.5 (2001/10/28).

Added PAM support (old-fashioned or via Linux-PAM binary prompts),
choice for fcntl(2) and/or flock(2) locking, qmail-style ~/Mailbox
support, improved logging, optional libwrap support, virtual domain
support hooks.

Parts of the daemon code are now run in a chroot jail (/var/empty).

The inetd vs. standalone mode setting is now run-time configurable.

The GNU MD5 routines have been replaced with own public domain
implementation to relax the license for the entire package (now BSD
and (L)GPL-compatible), solve certain portability issues, and reduce
code size.

Added a popa3d(8) manual page based on the one Camiel Dobbelaar wrote
for OpenBSD.
