	Installing popa3d.

1. Read the comments in params.h and edit the #define's to suit your
needs:

	$ vi params.h

It is especially important to choose a password authentication method
that will be right for your system (you need to pick exactly one) and
the mailbox locking method your system uses (it must match your other
mail software).

2. Possibly edit the Makefile (uncomment "-lcrypt" for Linux with
glibc, FreeBSD or NetBSD, uncomment "-lpam" if you will use PAM):

	$ vi Makefile

3. Build popa3d:

	$ make

4. Create a non-privileged popa3d user, like this (or using whatever
other user management commands your system has):

	# groupadd popa3d
	# useradd -g popa3d -d /dev/null -s /dev/null popa3d

5. Create an empty directory for popa3d to chroot to (unless your
system provides a directory intended for this purpose already):

	# mkdir -m 755 /var/empty

6. Install the popa3d binary and the man page under /usr/local:

	# make install

7. If you intend to start popa3d via inetd (rather than run it as a
standalone service), the /etc/inetd.conf line for popa3d should look
like this:

	pop3 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/popa3d

This assumes that you have and want to use TCP wrappers.  If not, you
may omit the tcpd (but see the note below).

Alternatively, if you're using xinetd, the configuration file section
may be like this:

service pop3
{
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	wait		= no
	user		= root
	server		= /usr/local/sbin/popa3d
	log_type	= SYSLOG daemon info
	log_on_success	= PID HOST DURATION
	log_on_failure	= HOST
	instances	= 100
	per_source	= 10
}

The last 5 attributes are optional.

Note: when started via an inetd clone, the logging of connections is
left up to that inetd clone or TCP wrappers.  If your inetd does not
log connecting IP addresses and you don't want to use TCP wrappers,
you should use popa3d in standalone mode.

To actually start the service, you need to tell your inetd to reload
configuration.  Typically, this is achieved by sending it a SIGHUP:

	# kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

For xinetd, the reload signal is either SIGUSR2 for older versions or
SIGHUP for newer ones, please consult your xinetd documentation.

8. If you intend to run popa3d as a standalone service (and you built
it with standalone mode support!), you need to start it with:

	# /usr/local/sbin/popa3d -D
