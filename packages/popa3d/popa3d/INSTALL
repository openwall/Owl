	Installing popa3d.

1. Read the comments in params.h and edit the #define's to suit your
needs:

	$ vi params.h

2. Possibly edit the Makefile (uncomment "-lcrypt" for Linux with
glibc, FreeBSD or NetBSD, uncomment "-lpam" if you will use PAM):

	$ vi Makefile

3. Build popa3d:

	$ make

4. Create a non-privileged popa3d user, like this (or using whatever
other user management commands your system has):

	# groupadd popa3d
	# useradd -g popa3d -d /dev/null -s /dev/null popa3d

5. Create an empty directory for popa3d to chroot to (unless your
system provides a directory intended for this purpose already):

	# mkdir -m 755 /var/empty

6. Install the popa3d binary and the man page under /usr/local:

	# make install

7. Edit your /etc/inetd.conf to use popa3d.  The line should look like
this:

	pop3 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/popa3d

Note: when started via an inetd clone, the logging of connections is
left up to that inetd clone or TCP wrappers.

8. Restart inetd by sending it a SIGHUP:

	# kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
