There are some notable differences between the Owl Postfix package
and the upstream source:

+ All services (except local, pipe, proxymap, and virtual) are configured
  by default to run chrooted.
+ The smtpd service is disabled by default, use control(8) utility
  to switch between enabled and disabled states.
+ The upstream main.cf is delivered as /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist,
  rather than cluttering /etc/postfix/main.cf with comments.
+ The following parameters have different default values:
  biff = no
  default_privs = postman
  disable_vrfy_command = yes
  local_minimum_uid = 500
  mailbox_unpriv_delivery = yes
  mynetworks_style = host
  smtpd_data_restrictions = reject_unauth_pipelining
  smtpd_etrn_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject
  smtpd_helo_required = yes
  virtual_mailbox_lock = fcntl
  virtual_minimum_uid = 500
