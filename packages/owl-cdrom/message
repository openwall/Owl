Please select the controller for your CD-ROM drive that you're booting from.

For IDE, select the channel and whether the drive is set to master or slave.
For SATA, SCSI, or USB, select "non-ide".

To boot an arbitrary Linux userland along with this CD's kernel (such as to
rescue an installed system), select "custom" and type " root=/dev/..."
(without the quotes and replacing the dots with your root filesystem device).
