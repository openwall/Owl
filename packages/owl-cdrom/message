TEXT HELP
To continue booting this CD's live + installable system, press Enter or just
wait a few seconds.  If this fails, try selecting "safe" (limits use of ACPI).

To boot an arbitrary Linux userland along with this CD's kernel (such as to
rescue an installed system), press Tab and edit the kernel parameters (e.g.,
delete the CD-specific options and edit the root device name).
