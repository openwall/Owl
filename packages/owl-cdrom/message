To continue booting this CD's live + installable system, press Enter or just
wait a few seconds.  If this fails, try selecting "safe" (limits use of ACPI).

To boot an arbitrary Linux userland along with this CD's kernel (such as to
rescue an installed system), select "rescue" AND TYPE " root=/dev/..."
without the quotes and replacing the dots with your root filesystem device.
For example, your boot line (below) might be "rescue root=/dev/sda2".
