.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B run\-parts
runs all the executable files named within constraints described below, found
in directory
.IR directory .
Other files and directories are silently ignored.

If the \-\-lsbsysinit option is not given then the names must consist
entirely of upper and lower case letters, digits, underscores, and
hyphens.                           
                                                                                
If the \-\-lsbsysinit option is given, then the names must not end
in .dpkg\-old  or .dpkg\-dist or .dpkg\-new or .dpkg\-tmp, and must
belong to one or more of the following namespaces: the
LANANA-assigned namespace (^[a\-z0\-9]+$); the LSB hierarchical and
reserved namespaces (^_?([a\-z0\-9_.]+\-)+[a\-z0\-9]+$);
and the Debian cron script namespace (^[a\-z0\-9][a\-z0\-9\-]*$).      

Files are run in the lexical sort order of their names unless the
\-\-reverse option is given, in which case they are run in the
opposite order.

.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-test
print the names of the scripts which would be run, but don't actually run
them.
.TP
.B \-\-list
print the names of the all matching files (not limited to executables),
but don't actually run them. This option cannot be used with --test.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
print the name of each script to stderr before running.
.TP
.B \-\-report
similar to
.BR \-\-verbose ,
but only prints the name of scripts which produce output.  The script's name is printed to whichever of stdout or stderr the script first produces output on.
.TP
.B \-\-reverse
reverse the scripts' execution order.
.TP
.B \-\-exit\-on\-error
exit as soon as a script returns with a non-zero exit code.
.TP
.B \-\-lsbsysinit
Use LSB namespaces instead of classical behavior.
.TP
.BI "\-u, \-\-umask=" umask
Sets the umask to
.I umask
before running the scripts.
.I umask
should be specified in octal.  By default the umask is set to 077.
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-arg=" argument
Pass
.I argument
to the scripts.  Use
.B --arg
once for each argument you want passed.
.TP
.B "\-\-"

will be not be interpreted as an option even if it starts with a
hyphen.
