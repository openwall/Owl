+adjtime \- smoothly tune kernel clock
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B #include <sys/time.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int adjtime(const struct timeval *" delta ", struct timeval *" olddelta );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This function speeds up or slows down the system clock in order to
+make a gradual adjustment.  This ensures that the calendar time
+reported by the system clock is always monotonically increasing, which
+might not happen if you simply set the clock.
+
+The
+.I delta
+argument specifies a relative adjustment to be made to the clock time.
+If negative, the system clock is slowed down fora while until it has
+lost this much elapsed time.  If positive, the system clock is speeded
+up for a while.
+
+If the
+.I olddelta
+argument is not a null pointer, the
+.B adjtime
+function returns information about any previous time adjustment that
+has not yet completed.
+
+This function is typically used to synchronize the clocks of computers
+in a local network.  You must be a privileged user to use it.
+.SH "RETURN VALUE"
+The
+.B adjtime
+function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure and sets the external
+variable
+.I errno
+accordingly.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EPERM
+The calling process does not have enough privileges to access the clock.
+.SH NOTE
+With a Linux kernel, you can use the 
+.BR adjtimex (2)
+function to permanently change the system clock speed.
+.SH "CONFORMING TO"
+This function is derived from 4.3 BSD and SVr4.

+.SH "RETURN VALUE"
+The
+.B readv()
+function returns the number of bytes or \-1 on error; the
+.B writev()
+function returns the number of bytes written.
+.SH ERRORS
+The

+and

+functions can fail and set

+to the following values:

+.B EAGAIN
+Non-blocking I/O had been selected in the

+.TP
+.B EINTR
+Reading or writing was interrupted before any data was transferred.
+.SH "CONFORMING TO"

+.SH BUGS
+It is not advisable to mix calls to functions like
