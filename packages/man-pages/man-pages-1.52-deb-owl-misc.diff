+.SH SYNOPSIS

+.sp
+.BI "void login(const struct utmp *" entry );
+.br
+.BI "int logout(const char *" ut_line );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The function
+.BR login ()
+inserts a new entry into the user accounting database (utmp file).
+The element
+.IB ut \->ut_line
+will be set to the name of the terminal on standard input.  If this is
+not a terminal,
+.BR login ()
+will use the standard output or standard error output to determine the
+name of the terminal.  The element
+.IB ut \->ut_type
+will be set to
+.BR USER_PROCESS ,
+.IB ut \->ut_pid
+will be set to the process id of the calling process.
+All remaining elements will be copied from
+.IR entry .
+
+A copy of the resulting
+.I entry
+is written to the user accounting log file.
+
+The
+.BR logout ()
+function modifies the user accounting database to indicate that the
+user on terminal
+.I ut_line
+has logged out.
+.SH "RETURN VALUES"
+The
+.BR logout ()
+function returns 1 if the entry was successfully written to the
+database, or 0 if an error occurred.
+.SH NOTE
+These functions are included in libutil, hence you'll need to add
+``-lutil'' to your compiler or linker command line.
+
+Note that the
+member
+.B ut_user
+of struct utmp is called
+.B ut_name
+in BSD.  Therefore,

+is defined as an alias for

+adjtime \- smoothly tune kernel clock
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B #include <sys/time.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int adjtime(const struct timeval *" delta ", struct timeval *" olddelta );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This function speeds up or slows down the system clock in order to
+make a gradual adjustment.  This ensures that the calendar time
+reported by the system clock is always monotonically increasing, which
+might not happen if you simply set the clock.
+
+The
+.I delta
+argument specifies a relative adjustment to be made to the clock time.
+If negative, the system clock is slowed down fora while until it has
+lost this much elapsed time.  If positive, the system clock is speeded
+up for a while.
+
+If the
+.I olddelta
+argument is not a null pointer, the
+.B adjtime
+function returns information about any previous time adjustment that
+has not yet completed.
+
+This function is typically used to synchronize the clocks of computers
+in a local network.  You must be a privileged user to use it.
+.SH "RETURN VALUE"
+The
+.B adjtime
+function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure and sets the external
+variable
+.I errno
+accordingly.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EPERM
+The calling process does not have enough privileges to access the clock.
+.SH NOTE
+With a Linux kernel, you can use the
