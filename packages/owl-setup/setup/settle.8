.TH SETTLE 8 "10 April 2006" "Openwall Project" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
settle \- the program which installs the Openwall/*/Linux on your hard disk
on a permanent basis.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B settle
.RB [ -d | -m ] 
.RB [ -b ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B settle
is an interactive program which guides you through the process of
Openwall/*/Linux installation. 
.PP
The program is able to work both with ncurses-based interface and with
.B dumb
interface, which will work on almost any terminal. If not explicitly
specified, the mode of the interface is detected automatically
(to the best the program can).
.PP
The program doesn't have any internal state. This means the
.B settle
's determination of the current system's state is based solely on
the information of currently mounted filesystems, activated swaps and
parameters read from configuration files within the system being created
(e.g.,
.B /etc/sysconfig/network
). It allows you to quit the program at any stage of the install process,
perform some steps of the process manually, then start
.B settle
again, and it will detect your changes. You can even shellout the program,
or do something using another terminal: the actual system's status is
redetected each time before the program displays it's main menu.
.PP
The installation process
.B settle
tries to follow is explained in the file
.B /usr/src/world/native/Owl-*/doc/INSTALL
on your Owl CD.
Basically speaking,
.B settle
mounts your choosen root filesystem on
.B /owl
directory, builds and tunes the new system there and bases all its
detections on the information read from there (e.g., from the file
.B /owl/etc/sysconfig/network
). See the
.B INSTALL
file for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
use dumb interface (no colors or cursor movements, simple dialog)
.TP
.B -m
try ncurses-based (menu-driven) interface. If the terminal's capabilities
are not sufficient, the program will fallback to the dumb interface anyway.
Currently this is the default behaviour. Note that
.B -m
and
.B -d
are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.B -b
in case of using ncurses-based interface, don't use colors even if terminal
capabilities look like sufficient for it; instead, just stay black and
white.
.TP
.B -h
print short usage information and exit.
