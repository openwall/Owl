.SH NAME
settle \- the system installer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B settle
.RB [ -d | -m ]
.RB [ -b ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B settle
is an interactive program which guides you through the process of
installing Openwall GNU/*/Linux on your hard drive.
.PP
The program has an ncurses-based and a dumb interface;
the latter will work on almost any terminal.
If not explicitly specified, the interface to use is detected automatically
based on capabilities of the terminal indicated by the
.I TERM
environment variable.
.PP
The program doesn't have any internal state.
This means that
.B settle
determines the current system state based solely on information such as
currently mounted filesystems, active swaps, and parameters read from
configuration files of the system being installed
(e.g.,
.IR /owl/etc/sysconfig/network ).
This allows you to quit the program at any stage of the installation
process, perform some steps of the process manually, then start
.B settle
again, and it will detect your changes.
You can even have
.B settle
run a shell for you or you can do something on another terminal:
.B settle
will re-detect the target system's status once you're back to the
program's main menu.
.PP
The installation process
.B settle
tries to follow is explained in the file
.I /usr/src/world/native/Owl-*/doc/INSTALL
on your Owl CD.
Basically,
.B settle
lets you partition your hard drive(s) as desired,
creates filesystems,
initializes swap partitions (if any) for use with Linux,
mounts your chosen root filesystem and any additional filesystems under
.IR /owl ,
installs and lets you configure the new system in there,
installs a kernel and a bootloader,
and finally reboots the machine cleanly (with your approval).
See the
.I INSTALL
file for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
use the dumb interface (no colors or cursor movements, simple dialog)
.TP
.B -m
try the ncurses-based (menu-driven) interface.
If the terminal's capabilities are not sufficient, the program will
fallback to the dumb interface anyway.
Currently this is the default.  Note that
.B -m
and
.B -d
are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.B -b
in case of using the ncurses-based interface, don't use colors even if
the terminal appears to be sufficiently capable;
instead, just stay black and white.
.TP
.B -h
print short usage information and exit.
