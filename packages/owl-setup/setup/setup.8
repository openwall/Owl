.TH SETUP 8 "10 April 2006" "Openwall Project" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
setup \- The system setup utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setup
.RB [ -d | -m ] 
.RB [ -b ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setup
is an interactive program which lets you configure your network, keyboard 
layout, time zone and set the root password in a way similar to that during
the system install process.
.PP
Just like the
.B settle
program,
.B setup
is able to work both with ncurses-based interface and with
.B dumb
interface, which will work on almost any terminal. If not explicitly
specified, the mode of the interface is detected automatically
(to the best the program can).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
use dumb interface (no colors or cursor movements, simple dialog)
.TP
.B -m
try ncurses-based (menu-driven) interface. If the terminal's capabilities
are not sufficient, the program will fallback to the dumb interface anyway.
Currently this is the default behaviour. Note that
.B -m
and
.B -d
are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.B -b
in case of using ncurses-based interface, don't use colors even if terminal
capabilities look like sufficient for it; instead, just stay black and
white.
.TP
.B -h
print short usage information and exit.
