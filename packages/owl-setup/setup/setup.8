.TH SETUP 8 "10 April 2006" "Openwall Project" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
setup \- the system configuration utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setup
.RB [ -d | -m ]
.RB [ -b ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B setup
is an interactive program which lets you configure your networking settings,
keyboard layout, and time zone, and set the root password in a way similar to
that used during the system install procedure.
.PP
Just like the
.B settle
program,
.B setup
has an ncurses-based and a dumb interface;
the latter will work on almost any terminal.
If not explicitly specified, the interface to use is detected automatically
based on capabilities of the terminal indicated by the
.I TERM
environment variable.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
use the dumb interface (no colors or cursor movements, simple dialog)
.TP
.B -m
try the ncurses-based (menu-driven) interface.
If the terminal's capabilities are not sufficient, the program will
fallback to the dumb interface anyway.
Currently this is the default.  Note that
.B -m
and
.B -d
are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.B -b
in case of using the ncurses-based interface, don't use colors even if
the terminal appears to be sufficiently capable;
instead, just stay black and white.
.TP
.B -h
print short usage information and exit.
