This needs to be properly investigated.  The parallel autotest and signal
handling test (#209) is working fine when is run during the normal RPM
build process, but it fails when it's a part of Owl's buildworld routine.

The test was working fine with RPM 4.2, but started to fail with the upgrade
to RPM 4.11.2.

Some messages on the net point out that the test is unreliable and depends
on the SIGPIPE behaviour, hence it's possible that newer RPM sets a different
environment when it runs under Owl's 'make buildworld'/
