+.IP "eod, seod"
+Space to end of valid data.  Used on streamer tape
+drives to append data to the logical and of tape.
+.IP setblk
+(SCSI tapes) Set the block size of the drive to
+.I count
+bytes per record.
+.IP setdensity
+(SCSI tapes) Set the tape density code to
+.I count.
+The proper codes to use with each drive should be looked up from the
+drive documentation.
+.IP drvbuffer
+(SCSI tapes) Set the tape drive buffer code to
+.I number.
+The proper value for unbuffered operation is zero and "normal" buffered
+operation one. The meanings of other values can be found in the drive
+documentation or, in case of a SCSI-2 drive, from the SCSI-2 standard.
+.IP stoptions
+(SCSI tapes) Set the driver options bits to
+.I count
+for the device.
+The bits can be set by oring the following values: 1 to enable write
+buffering, 2 to enable asynchronous writes, 4 to enable read ahead,
+8 to enable debugging output (if it has been compiled to the driver).
+.IP stwrthreshold
+(SCSI tapes) The write threshold for the tape device is set to
+.I count
+kilobytes. The value must be smaller than or equal to the driver
+buffer size.
+.IP seek
+(SCSI tapes) Seek to the
+.I count
+block on the tape.  This operation is available on some
+Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.
+.IP tell
+(SCSI tapes) Tell the current block on tape.  This operation is available on some
+Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.
+.IP densities
+(SCSI tapes) Write explanation of some common density codes to
+standard output.
+.IP datcompression
+(some SCSI-2 DAT tapes) Inquire or set the compression status
+(on/off). If the
+.I count
+is one the compression status is printed. If the
+.I count
+is zero, compression is disabled. Otherwise, compression is
+enabled. The command uses the SCSI ioctl to read and write the Data
+Compression Characteristics mode page (15). ONLY ROOT CAN USE THIS
