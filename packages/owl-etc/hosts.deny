#
# hosts.deny access control file for "tcp wrapped" services.  This file
# is consulted by tcpd(8) and services that are linked against libwrap.
#
# See hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5) for the format of this file.
#
# Note that the "allow" and "deny" keywords described in hosts_options(5)
# make it possible to keep all access control rules within a single file.
# For example, you could use hosts.allow only and leave this file empty.
