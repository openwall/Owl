%description
pam_userpass is a PAM authentication module for use specifically by
services implementing non-interactive protocols and wishing to verify
a username/password pair.  This module doesn't do any actual
authentication, -- other modules, such as pam_tcb, should be stacked
after it to provide the authentication.
