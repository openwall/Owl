With the -g option, grops will generate PostScript code that guesses
the page height.  This allows documents to be printed on both Letter
(8.5x11) and A4 paper without change.

There's the a4.tmac macro file for specifying A4 paper format.  Read
the comment inside that file for usage instructions.

Below are the older A4 setup instructions with minor updates:

The PostScript (and HPLJ) output drivers for groff lack support for printing
on A4 paper.  Setting up for A4 paper is not documented for groff.

The following file could be supplied with the groff distribution to support
the use of A4 paper (used in much of the world instead of the Letter format
used widely in the US).  This is a modified version of
	/usr/share/groff/*/font/devps/DESC.
I don't know the best way to set this up at install time.

In my system, I have both files (DESC.a4 and DESC.letter) and a symlink from
DESC to the correct one).  The modifications are to the "unitwidth" (reduced
from 1000 to 970, and "paperlength" (increased from 792000 to 841890).  The
HPLJ output driver needs a similar fix, but the parameters are different.
