.SH NAME
sulogin \- the single user mode login program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsulogin\fR [\fB-p\fR] [\fB-t \fItimeout\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sulogin
is a program to force the console user to login under a root account
before a shell is started.
Unlike other implementations of
.BR sulogin ,
this one supports having multiple root accounts on a system.
.PP
.B sulogin
is typically invoked from an
.BR inittab (5)
entry for single user mode or from the system's startup scripts.
.PP
It is important to understand that the use of
.B sulogin
alone may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access to the system
from the console.
The firmware (BIOS) and the boot loader may by default provide user
interaction capabilities that enable access to the system bypassing
its regular startup.
.SH OPTIONS
The supported command line options match those used with
Miquel van Smoorenburg's implementation of
.BR sulogin .
.TP
.B -p
Make the shell started by
.B sulogin
a login shell by setting the first character of its argument zero to a
dash ('-').
Typically, a login shell will process local profile files such as
.IR /etc/profile .
.TP
.BI "-t " timeout
Request that
.B sulogin
will timeout and exit if there's no input to a prompt in the specified
number of seconds.
.SH EXIT CODE
The exit code of
.B sulogin
upon its successful completion is that of the shell started.
Other possible exit codes are:
64 on system failure or misconfiguration,
65 on timeout, and
66 on EOF (Ctrl-D).
.SH HISTORY
Implementations of
.B sulogin
exist in multiple commercial and free Unix flavors, although
.B sulogin
was not a part of AT&T System V.
.PP
This implementation with its support for multiple root accounts
originates in Openwall GNU/*/Linux.
